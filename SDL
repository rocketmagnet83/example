The modules listed here are part of the CMake distribution.
Projects may provide further modules; their location(s)
can be specified in the ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`` variable.

Utility Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These modules are loaded using the ``include()`` command.

AddFileDependencies
-------------------

Add dependencies to a source file.

 ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<source> <files>)

Adds the given ``<files>`` to the dependencies of file ``<source>``.

AndroidTestUtilities
------------------------

Create a test that automatically loads specified data onto an Android device.

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use this module to push data needed for testing an Android device behavior
onto a connected Android device. The module will accept files and libraries as
well as separate destinations for each. It will create a test that loads the
files into a device object store and link to them from the specified
destination. The files are only uploaded if they are not already in the object
store.

For example:

 include(AndroidTestUtilities)
 android_add_test_data(
   example_setup_test
   FILES <files>...
   LIBS <libs>...
   DEVICE_TEST_DIR "/data/local/tests/example"
   DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE "/sdcard/.ExternalData/SHA"
   )

At build time a test named "example_setup_test" will be created.  Run this test
on the command line with ``ctest(1)`` to load the data onto the Android
device.

Module Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: android_add_test_data

  .. code-block:: cmake

    android_add_test_data(<test-name>
      [FILES <files>...] [FILES_DEST <device-dir>]
      [LIBS <libs>...]   [LIBS_DEST <device-dir>]
      [DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE <device-dir>]
      [DEVICE_TEST_DIR <device-dir>]
      [NO_LINK_REGEX <strings>...]
      )

  The ``android_add_test_data`` function is used to copy files and libraries
  needed to run project-specific tests. On the host operating system, this is
  done at build time. For on-device testing, the files are loaded onto the
  device by the manufactured test at run time.

  This function accepts the following named parameters:

  ``FILES <files>...``
    zero or more files needed for testing
  ``LIBS <libs>...``
    zero or more libraries needed for testing
  ``FILES_DEST <device-dir>``
    absolute path where the data files are expected to be
  ``LIBS_DEST <device-dir>``
    absolute path where the libraries are expected to be
  ``DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE <device-dir>``
    absolute path to the location where the data is stored on-device
  ``DEVICE_TEST_DIR <device-dir>``
    absolute path to the root directory of the on-device test location
  ``NO_LINK_REGEX <strings>...``
    list of regex strings matching the names of files that should be
    copied from the object store to the testing directory

BundleUtilities
---------------

Functions to help assemble a standalone bundle application.

A collection of CMake utility functions useful for dealing with .app
bundles on the Mac and bundle-like directories on any OS.

The following functions are provided by this module:

 fixup_bundle
 copy_and_fixup_bundle
 verify_app
 get_bundle_main_executable
 get_dotapp_dir
 get_bundle_and_executable
 get_bundle_all_executables
 get_item_key
 get_item_rpaths
 clear_bundle_keys
 set_bundle_key_values
 get_bundle_keys
 copy_resolved_item_into_bundle
 copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle
 fixup_bundle_item
 verify_bundle_prerequisites
 verify_bundle_symlinks

Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function, break and
PARENT_SCOPE.  Also depends on GetPrerequisites.cmake.

DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS AT CONFIGURE TIME (from ``CMakeLists.txt``)!
Instead, invoke them from an ``install(CODE)`` or
``install(SCRIPT)`` rule.

 fixup_bundle(<app> <libs> <dirs>)

Fix up a bundle in-place and make it standalone, such that it can be
drag-n-drop copied to another machine and run on that machine as long
as all of the system libraries are compatible.

If you pass plugins to fixup_bundle as the libs parameter, you should
install them or copy them into the bundle before calling fixup_bundle.
The "libs" parameter is a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but
that cannot be determined by otool output analysis.  (i.e., plugins)

Gather all the keys for all the executables and libraries in a bundle,
and then, for each key, copy each prerequisite into the bundle.  Then
fix each one up according to its own list of prerequisites.

Then clear all the keys and call verify_app on the final bundle to
ensure that it is truly standalone.

As an optional parameter (IGNORE_ITEM) a list of file names can be passed,
which are then ignored (e.g. IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe")

 copy_and_fixup_bundle(<src> <dst> <libs> <dirs>)

Makes a copy of the bundle <src> at location <dst> and then fixes up
the new copied bundle in-place at <dst>...

 verify_app(<app>)

Verifies that an application <app> appears valid based on running
analysis tools on it.  Calls "message(FATAL_ERROR" if the application
is not verified.

As an optional parameter (IGNORE_ITEM) a list of file names can be passed,
which are then ignored (e.g. IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe")

 get_bundle_main_executable(<bundle> <result_var>)

The result will be the full path name of the bundle's main executable
file or an "error:" prefixed string if it could not be determined.

 get_dotapp_dir(<exe> <dotapp_dir_var>)

Returns the nearest parent dir whose name ends with ".app" given the
full path to an executable.  If there is no such parent dir, then
simply return the dir containing the executable.

The returned directory may or may not exist.

 get_bundle_and_executable(<app> <bundle_var> <executable_var> <valid_var>)

Takes either a ".app" directory name or the name of an executable
nested inside a ".app" directory and returns the path to the ".app"
directory in <bundle_var> and the path to its main executable in
<executable_var>

 get_bundle_all_executables(<bundle> <exes_var>)

Scans the given bundle recursively for all executable files and
accumulates them into a variable.

 get_item_key(<item> <key_var>)

Given a file (item) name, generate a key that should be unique
considering the set of libraries that need copying or fixing up to
make a bundle standalone.  This is essentially the file name including
extension with "." replaced by "_"

This key is used as a prefix for CMake variables so that we can
associate a set of variables with a given item based on its key.

 clear_bundle_keys(<keys_var>)

Loop over the list of keys, clearing all the variables associated with
each key.  After the loop, clear the list of keys itself.

Caller of get_bundle_keys should call clear_bundle_keys when done with
list of keys.

 set_bundle_key_values(<keys_var> <context> <item> <exepath> <dirs>
                       <copyflag> [<rpaths>])

Add a key to the list (if necessary) for the given item.  If added,
also set all the variables associated with that key.

 get_bundle_keys(<app> <libs> <dirs> <keys_var>)

Loop over all the executable and library files within the bundle (and
given as extra <libs>) and accumulate a list of keys representing
them.  Set values associated with each key such that we can loop over
all of them and copy prerequisite libs into the bundle and then do
appropriate install_name_tool fixups.

As an optional parameter (IGNORE_ITEM) a list of file names can be passed,
which are then ignored (e.g. IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe")

 copy_resolved_item_into_bundle(<resolved_item> <resolved_embedded_item>)

Copy a resolved item into the bundle if necessary.  Copy is not
necessary if the resolved_item is "the same as" the
resolved_embedded_item.

 copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle(<resolved_item> <resolved_embedded_item>)

Copy a resolved framework into the bundle if necessary.  Copy is not
necessary if the resolved_item is "the same as" the
resolved_embedded_item.

By default, BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS is not set.  If you want
full frameworks embedded in your bundles, set
BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS to ON before calling fixup_bundle.  By
default, COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE copies the framework
dylib itself plus the framework Resources directory.

 fixup_bundle_item(<resolved_embedded_item> <exepath> <dirs>)

Get the direct/non-system prerequisites of the resolved embedded item.
For each prerequisite, change the way it is referenced to the value of
the _EMBEDDED_ITEM keyed variable for that prerequisite.  (Most likely
changing to an "@executable_path" style reference.)

This function requires that the resolved_embedded_item be "inside" the
bundle already.  In other words, if you pass plugins to fixup_bundle
as the libs parameter, you should install them or copy them into the
bundle before calling fixup_bundle.  The "libs" parameter is a list of
libraries that must be fixed up, but that cannot be determined by
otool output analysis.  (i.e., plugins)

Also, change the id of the item being fixed up to its own
_EMBEDDED_ITEM value.

Accumulate changes in a local variable and make *one* call to
install_name_tool at the end of the function with all the changes at
once.

If the BU_CHMOD_BUNDLE_ITEMS variable is set then bundle items will be
marked writable before install_name_tool tries to change them.

 verify_bundle_prerequisites(<bundle> <result_var> <info_var>)

Verifies that the sum of all prerequisites of all files inside the
bundle are contained within the bundle or are "system" libraries,
presumed to exist everywhere.

As an optional parameter (IGNORE_ITEM) a list of file names can be passed,
which are then ignored (e.g. IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe")

 verify_bundle_symlinks(<bundle> <result_var> <info_var>)

Verifies that any symlinks found in the bundle point to other files
that are already also in the bundle...  Anything that points to an
external file causes this function to fail the verification.

CheckCCompilerFlag
------------------

Check whether the C compiler supports a given flag.

.. command:: check_c_compiler_flag

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_c_compiler_flag(<flag> <var>)

  Check that the ``<flag>`` is accepted by the compiler without
  a diagnostic.  Stores the result in an internal cache entry
  named ``<var>``.

This command temporarily sets the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS`` variable
and calls the ``check_c_source_compiles`` macro from the
``CheckCSourceCompiles`` module.  See documentation of that
module for a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build.

A positive result from this check indicates only that the compiler did not
issue a diagnostic message when given the flag.  Whether the flag has any
effect or even a specific one is beyond the scope of this module.

.. note::
  Since the ``try_compile()`` command forwards flags from variables
  like ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS``, unknown flags
  in such variables may cause a false negative for this check.

CheckCSourceCompiles
--------------------

Check if given C source compiles and links into an executable.

.. command:: check_c_source_compiles

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_c_source_compiles(<code> <resultVar>
                            [FAIL_REGEX <regex1> [<regex2>...]])

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a C source
  file and linked as an executable (so it must contain at least a ``main()``
  function). The result will be stored in the internal cache variable specified
  by ``<resultVar>``, with a boolean true value for success and boolean false
  for failure. If ``FAIL_REGEX`` is provided, then failure is determined by
  checking if anything in the output matches any of the specified regular
  expressions.

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_compile()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_c_source_compiles()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_compile()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_compile()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_compile()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckCSourceRuns
----------------

Check if given C source compiles and links into an executable and can
subsequently be run.

.. command:: check_c_source_runs

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_c_source_runs(<code> <resultVar>)

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a C source
  file, linked as an executable and then run. The ``<code>`` must contain at
  least a ``main()`` function. If the ``<code>`` could be built and run
  successfully, the internal cache variable specified by ``<resultVar>`` will
  be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to an value that evaluates to boolean
  false (e.g. an empty string or an error message).

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_run()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_c_source_runs()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_run()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_run()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_run()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckCXXCompilerFlag
------------------------

Check whether the CXX compiler supports a given flag.

.. command:: check_cxx_compiler_flag

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_cxx_compiler_flag(<flag> <var>)

  Check that the ``<flag>`` is accepted by the compiler without
  a diagnostic.  Stores the result in an internal cache entry
  named ``<var>``.

This command temporarily sets the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS`` variable
and calls the ``check_cxx_source_compiles`` macro from the
``CheckCXXSourceCompiles`` module.  See documentation of that
module for a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build.

A positive result from this check indicates only that the compiler did not
issue a diagnostic message when given the flag.  Whether the flag has any
effect or even a specific one is beyond the scope of this module.

.. note::
  Since the ``try_compile()`` command forwards flags from variables
  like ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS``, unknown flags
  in such variables may cause a false negative for this check.

CheckCXXSourceCompiles
----------------------

Check if given C++ source compiles and links into an executable.

.. command:: check_cxx_source_compiles

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_cxx_source_compiles(<code> <resultVar>
                              [FAIL_REGEX <regex1> [<regex2>...]])

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a C++ source
  file and linked as an executable (so it must contain at least a ``main()``
  function). The result will be stored in the internal cache variable specified
  by ``<resultVar>``, with a boolean true value for success and boolean false
  for failure. If ``FAIL_REGEX`` is provided, then failure is determined by
  checking if anything in the output matches any of the specified regular
  expressions.

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_compile()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_cxx_source_compiles()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_compile()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_compile()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_compile()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckCXXSourceRuns
------------------

Check if given C++ source compiles and links into an executable and can
subsequently be run.

.. command:: check_cxx_source_runs

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_cxx_source_runs(<code> <resultVar>)

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a C++ source
  file, linked as an executable and then run. The ``<code>`` must contain at
  least a ``main()`` function. If the ``<code>`` could be built and run
  successfully, the internal cache variable specified by ``<resultVar>`` will
  be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to an value that evaluates to boolean
  false (e.g. an empty string or an error message).

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_run()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_cxx_source_runs()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_run()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_run()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_run()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckCXXSymbolExists
--------------------

Check if a symbol exists as a function, variable, or macro in C++

.. command:: CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS(<symbol> <files> <variable>)

  Check that the ``<symbol>`` is available after including given header
  ``<files>`` and store the result in a ``<variable>``.  Specify the list of
  files in one argument as a semicolon-separated list.
  ``CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS()`` can be used to check in C++ files, as
  opposed to ``CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS()``, which works only for ``C``.

  If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered
  available and assumed to work.  If the header files declare the symbol
  as a function or variable then the symbol must also be available for
  linking.  If the symbol is a type or enum value it will not be
  recognized (consider using ``CheckTypeSize``
  or ``CheckCSourceCompiles``).

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

CheckFortranCompilerFlag
------------------------

Check whether the Fortran compiler supports a given flag.

.. command:: check_fortran_compiler_flag

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_compiler_flag(<flag> <var>)

  Check that the ``<flag>`` is accepted by the compiler without
  a diagnostic.  Stores the result in an internal cache entry
  named ``<var>``.

This command temporarily sets the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS`` variable
and calls the ``check_fortran_source_compiles`` macro from the
``CheckFortranSourceCompiles`` module.  See documentation of that
module for a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build.

A positive result from this check indicates only that the compiler did not
issue a diagnostic message when given the flag.  Whether the flag has any
effect or even a specific one is beyond the scope of this module.

.. note::
  Since the ``try_compile()`` command forwards flags from variables
  like ``CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS``, unknown flags
  in such variables may cause a false negative for this check.

CheckFortranFunctionExists
--------------------------

Check if a Fortran function exists.

.. command:: CHECK_FORTRAN_FUNCTION_EXISTS

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_FORTRAN_FUNCTION_EXISTS(<function> <result>)

  where

  ``<function>``
    the name of the Fortran function
  ``<result>``
    variable to store the result; will be created as an internal cache variable.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
  command (see ``try_compile()`` for further details).

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
  :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_compile()`` for
  further details).

CheckFortranSourceCompiles
--------------------------

Check if given Fortran source compiles and links into an executable.

.. command:: check_fortran_source_compiles

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_source_compiles(<code> <resultVar>
        [FAIL_REGEX <regex>...]
        [SRC_EXT <extension>]
    )

  Checks that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a Fortran
  source file and linked as an executable. The ``<code>`` must be a Fortran program
  containing at least an ``end`` statement--for example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_source_compiles("character :: b; error stop b; end" F2018ESTOPOK SRC_EXT F90)

  This command can help avoid costly build processes when a compiler lacks support
  for a necessary feature, or a particular vendor library is not compatible with
  the Fortran compiler version being used. This generate-time check may advise the
  user of such before the main build process. See also the
  ``check_fortran_source_runs()`` command to actually run the compiled code.

  The result will be stored in the internal cache
  variable ``<resultVar>``, with a boolean true value for success and boolean
  false for failure.

  If ``FAIL_REGEX`` is provided, then failure is determined by checking
  if anything in the output matches any of the specified regular expressions.

  By default, the test source file will be given a ``.F`` file extension. The
  ``SRC_EXT`` option can be used to override this with ``.<extension>`` instead--
  ``.F90`` is a typical choice.

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_compile()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_fortran_source_compiles()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_compile()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_compile()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_compile()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckFortranSourceRuns
----------------------

Check if given Fortran source compiles and links into an executable and can
subsequently be run.

.. command:: check_fortran_source_runs

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_source_runs(<code> <resultVar>
        [SRC_EXT <extension>])

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a Fortran source
  file, linked as an executable and then run. The ``<code>`` must be a Fortran program
  containing at least an ``end`` statement--for example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_source_runs("real :: x[*]; call co_sum(x); end" F2018coarrayOK)

  This command can help avoid costly build processes when a compiler lacks support
  for a necessary feature, or a particular vendor library is not compatible with
  the Fortran compiler version being used. Some of these failures only occur at runtime
  instead of linktime, and a trivial runtime example can catch the issue before the
  main build process.

  If the ``<code>`` could be built and run
  successfully, the internal cache variable specified by ``<resultVar>`` will
  be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to an value that evaluates to boolean
  false (e.g. an empty string or an error message).

  By default, the test source file will be given a ``.F90`` file extension. The
  ``SRC_EXT`` option can be used to override this with ``.<extension>`` instead.

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_run()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_fortran_source_runs()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_run()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_run()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_run()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckFunctionExists
-------------------

Check if a C function can be linked

.. command:: check_function_exists

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_function_exists(<function> <variable>)

  Checks that the ``<function>`` is provided by libraries on the system and store
  the result in a ``<variable>``, which will be created as an internal
  cache variable.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the
way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

.. note::

  Prefer using :Module:`CheckSymbolExists` instead of this module,
  for the following reasons:

  * ``check_function_exists()`` can't detect functions that are inlined
    in headers or specified as a macro.

  * ``check_function_exists()`` can't detect anything in the 32-bit
    versions of the Win32 API, because of a mismatch in calling conventions.

  * ``check_function_exists()`` only verifies linking, it does not verify
    that the function is declared in system headers.

CheckIPOSupported
-----------------

Check whether the compiler supports an interprocedural optimization (IPO/LTO).
Use this before enabling the ``INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`` target
property.

.. command:: check_ipo_supported

  ::

   check_ipo_supported([RESULT <result>] [OUTPUT <output>]
                       [LANGUAGES <lang>...])

 Options are:

 ``RESULT <result>``
   Set ``<result>`` variable to ``YES`` if IPO is supported by the
   compiler and ``NO`` otherwise.  If this option is not given then
   the command will issue a fatal error if IPO is not supported.
 ``OUTPUT <output>``
   Set ``<output>`` variable with details about any error.
 ``LANGUAGES <lang>...``
   Specify languages whose compilers to check.
   Languages ``C``, ``CXX``, and ``Fortran`` are supported.

It makes no sense to use this module when ``CMP0069`` is set to ``OLD`` so
module will return error in this case. See policy ``CMP0069`` for details.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

 check_ipo_supported() # fatal error if IPO is not supported
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)

 # Optional IPO. Do not use IPO if it's not supported by compiler.
 check_ipo_supported(RESULT result OUTPUT output)
 if(result)
   set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)
 else()
   message(WARNING "IPO is not supported: ${output}")
 endif()

CheckIncludeFileCXX
-------------------

Provides a macro to check if a header file can be included in ``CXX``.

.. command:: CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_CXX

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_CXX(<include> <variable> [<flags>])

  Check if the given ``<include>`` file may be included in a ``CXX``
  source file and store the result in an internal cache entry named
  ``<variable>``.  The optional third argument may be used to add
  compilation flags to the check (or use ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS`` below).

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

See modules ``CheckIncludeFile`` and ``CheckIncludeFiles``
to check for one or more ``C`` headers.

CheckIncludeFile
----------------

Provides a macro to check if a header file can be included in ``C``.

.. command:: CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE(<include> <variable> [<flags>])

  Check if the given ``<include>`` file may be included in a ``C``
  source file and store the result in an internal cache entry named
  ``<variable>``.  The optional third argument may be used to add
  compilation flags to the check (or use ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS`` below).

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

See the ``CheckIncludeFiles`` module to check for multiple headers
at once.  See the ``CheckIncludeFileCXX`` module to check for headers
using the ``CXX`` language.

CheckIncludeFiles
-----------------

Provides a macro to check if a list of one or more header files can
be included together.

.. command:: CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES("<includes>" <variable> [LANGUAGE <language>])

  Check if the given ``<includes>`` list may be included together
  in a source file and store the result in an internal cache
  entry named ``<variable>``.  Specify the ``<includes>`` argument
  as a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header file names.

  If ``LANGUAGE`` is set, the specified compiler will be used to perform the
  check. Acceptable values are ``C`` and ``CXX``. If not set, the C compiler
  will be used if enabled. If the C compiler is not enabled, the C++
  compiler will be used if enabled.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

See modules ``CheckIncludeFile`` and ``CheckIncludeFileCXX``
to check for a single header file in ``C`` or ``CXX`` languages.

CheckLanguage
-------------

Check if a language can be enabled

Usage:

::

 check_language(<lang>)

where <lang> is a language that may be passed to enable_language()
such as "Fortran".  If CMAKE_<lang>_COMPILER is already defined the
check does nothing.  Otherwise it tries enabling the language in a
test project.  The result is cached in CMAKE_<lang>_COMPILER as the
compiler that was found, or NOTFOUND if the language cannot be
enabled.

Example:

::

 check_language(Fortran)
 if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER)
   enable_language(Fortran)
 else()
   message(STATUS "No Fortran support")
 endif()

CheckLibraryExists
------------------

Check if the function exists.

.. command:: CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS(LIBRARY FUNCTION LOCATION VARIABLE)

  ::

 LIBRARY  - the name of the library you are looking for
 FUNCTION - the name of the function
 LOCATION - location where the library should be found
 VARIABLE - variable to store the result
            Will be created as an internal cache variable.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

::

 CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS = list of options to pass to link command
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET = execute quietly without messages

CheckPIESupported
-----------------

Check whether the linker supports position independent code (PIE) or no
position independent code (NO_PIE) for executables.
Use this to ensure that the ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` target
property for executables will be honored at link time.

.. command:: check_pie_supported

  ::

   check_pie_supported([OUTPUT_VARIABLE <output>]
                       [LANGUAGES <lang>...])

 Options are:

 ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE <output>``
   Set ``<output>`` variable with details about any error.
 ``LANGUAGES <lang>...``
   Check the linkers used for each of the specified languages.
   Supported languages are ``C``, ``CXX``, and ``Fortran``.

It makes no sense to use this module when ``CMP0083`` is set to ``OLD``,
so the command will return an error in this case.  See policy ``CMP0083``
for details.

Variables
^^^^^^^^^

For each language checked, two boolean cache variables are defined.

 ``CMAKE_<lang>_LINK_PIE_SUPPORTED``
   Set to ``YES`` if ``PIE`` is supported by the linker and ``NO`` otherwise.
 ``CMAKE_<lang>_LINK_NO_PIE_SUPPORTED``
   Set to ``YES`` if ``NO_PIE`` is supported by the linker and ``NO`` otherwise.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

 check_pie_supported()
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE TRUE)

 # Retrieve any error message.
 check_pie_supported(OUTPUT_VARIABLE output LANGUAGES C)
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE TRUE)
 if(NOT CMAKE_C_LINK_PIE_SUPPORTED)
   message(WARNING "PIE is not supported at link time: ${output}.\n"
                   "PIE link options will not be passed to linker.")
 endif()

CheckPrototypeDefinition
------------------------

Check if the prototype we expect is correct.

.. command:: check_prototype_definition

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_prototype_definition(FUNCTION PROTOTYPE RETURN HEADER VARIABLE)

  ::

   FUNCTION - The name of the function (used to check if prototype exists)
   PROTOTYPE- The prototype to check.
   RETURN - The return value of the function.
   HEADER - The header files required.
   VARIABLE - The variable to store the result.
              Will be created as an internal cache variable.

 Example:

 .. code-block:: cmake

   check_prototype_definition(getpwent_r
    "struct passwd *getpwent_r(struct passwd *src, char *buf, int buflen)"
    "NULL"
    "unistd.h;pwd.h"
    SOLARIS_GETPWENT_R)

The following variables may be set before calling this function to modify
the way the check is run:

::

 CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS = list of options to pass to link command
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET = execute quietly without messages

CheckStructHasMember
--------------------

Check if the given struct or class has the specified member variable

.. command:: CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER(<struct> <member> <header> <variable>
                            [LANGUAGE <language>])

  ::

 <struct> - the name of the struct or class you are interested in
 <member> - the member which existence you want to check
 <header> - the header(s) where the prototype should be declared
 <variable> - variable to store the result
 <language> - the compiler to use (C or CXX)

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

::

 CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS = list of options to pass to link command
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET = execute quietly without messages

Example:

 CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER("struct timeval" tv_sec sys/select.h
                         HAVE_TIMEVAL_TV_SEC LANGUAGE C)

CheckSymbolExists
-----------------

Provides a macro to check if a symbol exists as a function, variable,
or macro in ``C``.

.. command:: check_symbol_exists

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_symbol_exists(<symbol> <files> <variable>)

  Check that the ``<symbol>`` is available after including given header
  ``<files>`` and store the result in a ``<variable>``.  Specify the list
  of files in one argument as a semicolon-separated list.
  ``<variable>`` will be created as an internal cache variable.

If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered
available and assumed to work.  If the header files declare the symbol
as a function or variable then the symbol must also be available for
linking (so intrinsics may not be detected).
If the symbol is a type, enum value, or intrinsic it will not be recognized
(consider using ``CheckTypeSize`` or ``CheckCSourceCompiles``).
If the check needs to be done in C++, consider using
``CheckCXXSymbolExists`` instead.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

CheckTypeSize
-------------

Check sizeof a type

.. command:: CHECK_TYPE_SIZE

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_TYPE_SIZE(TYPE VARIABLE [BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY]
                                  [LANGUAGE <language>])

  Check if the type exists and determine its size.  On return,
  ``HAVE_${VARIABLE}`` holds the existence of the type, and ``${VARIABLE}``
  holds one of the following:

  ::

    <size> = type has non-zero size <size>
    "0"    = type has arch-dependent size (see below)
    ""     = type does not exist

 Both ``HAVE_${VARIABLE}`` and ``${VARIABLE}`` will be created as internal
 cache variables.

 Furthermore, the variable ``${VARIABLE}_CODE`` holds C preprocessor code
 to define the macro ``${VARIABLE}`` to the size of the type, or leave
 the macro undefined if the type does not exist.

 The variable ``${VARIABLE}`` may be ``0`` when
 :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` has multiple architectures for building
 OS X universal binaries.  This indicates that the type size varies across
 architectures.  In this case ``${VARIABLE}_CODE`` contains C preprocessor
 tests mapping from each architecture macro to the corresponding type size.
 The list of architecture macros is stored in ``${VARIABLE}_KEYS``, and the
 value for each key is stored in ``${VARIABLE}-${KEY}``.

 If the ``BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY`` option is not given, the macro checks for
 headers ``<sys/types.h>``, ``<stdint.h>``, and ``<stddef.h>``, and saves
 results in ``HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H``, ``HAVE_STDINT_H``, and ``HAVE_STDDEF_H``.
 The type size check automatically includes the available headers, thus
 supporting checks of types defined in the headers.

 If ``LANGUAGE`` is set, the specified compiler will be used to perform the
 check. Acceptable values are ``C`` and ``CXX``.

Despite the name of the macro you may use it to check the size of more
complex expressions, too.  To check e.g.  for the size of a struct
member you can do something like this:

 check_type_size("((struct something*)0)->member" SIZEOF_MEMBER)

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

::

 CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS  = list of options to pass to link command
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET = execute quietly without messages
 CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES = list of extra headers to include

CheckVariableExists
-------------------

Check if the variable exists.

.. command:: CHECK_VARIABLE_EXISTS

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_VARIABLE_EXISTS(VAR VARIABLE)


  ::

   VAR      - the name of the variable
   VARIABLE - variable to store the result
              Will be created as an internal cache variable.


 This macro is only for ``C`` variables.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

::

 CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS = list of options to pass to link command
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET = execute quietly without messages

CMakeAddFortranSubdirectory
---------------------------

Add a fortran-only subdirectory, find a fortran compiler, and build.

The ``cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory`` function adds a subdirectory
to a project that contains a fortran-only subproject.  The module will
check the current compiler and see if it can support fortran.  If no
fortran compiler is found and the compiler is MSVC, then this module
will find the MinGW gfortran.  It will then use an external project to
build with the MinGW tools.  It will also create imported targets for
the libraries created.  This will only work if the fortran code is
built into a dll, so ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` is turned on in
the project.  In addition the ``CMAKE_GNUtoMS`` option is set
to on, so that Microsoft .lib files are created.  Usage is as follows:

::

 cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory(
  <subdir>                # name of subdirectory
  PROJECT <project_name>  # project name in subdir top CMakeLists.txt
  ARCHIVE_DIR <dir>       # dir where project places .lib files
  RUNTIME_DIR <dir>       # dir where project places .dll files
  LIBRARIES <lib>...      # names of library targets to import
  LINK_LIBRARIES          # link interface libraries for LIBRARIES
   [LINK_LIBS <lib> <dep>...]...
  CMAKE_COMMAND_LINE ...  # extra command line flags to pass to cmake
  NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL     # skip installation of external project
  )

Relative paths in ARCHIVE_DIR and RUNTIME_DIR are interpreted with
respect to the build directory corresponding to the source directory
in which the function is invoked.

Limitations:

NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL is required for forward compatibility with a
future version that supports installation of the external project
binaries during "make install".

CMakeBackwardCompatibilityCXX
-----------------------------

define a bunch of backwards compatibility variables

::

 CMAKE_ANSI_CXXFLAGS - flag for ansi c++
 CMAKE_HAS_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - has <strstream>
 include(TestForANSIStreamHeaders)
 include(CheckIncludeFileCXX)
 include(TestForSTDNamespace)
 include(TestForANSIForScope)

CMakeDependentOption
--------------------

Macro to provide an option dependent on other options.

This macro presents an option to the user only if a set of other
conditions are true.  When the option is not presented a default value
is used, but any value set by the user is preserved for when the
option is presented again.  Example invocation:

::

 CMAKE_DEPENDENT_OPTION(USE_FOO "Use Foo" ON
                        "USE_BAR;NOT USE_ZOT" OFF)

If USE_BAR is true and USE_ZOT is false, this provides an option
called USE_FOO that defaults to ON.  Otherwise, it sets USE_FOO to
OFF.  If the status of USE_BAR or USE_ZOT ever changes, any value for
the USE_FOO option is saved so that when the option is re-enabled it
retains its old value.

CMakeFindDependencyMacro
-------------------------

.. command:: find_dependency

  The ``find_dependency()`` macro wraps a ``find_package()`` call for
  a package dependency::

   find_dependency(<dep> [...])

 It is designed to be used in a
 :ref:`Package Configuration File <Config File Packages>`
 (``<PackageName>Config.cmake``).  ``find_dependency`` forwards the correct
 parameters for ``QUIET`` and ``REQUIRED`` which were passed to
 the original :command:`find_package` call.  Any additional arguments
 specified are forwarded to :command:`find_package`.

 If the dependency could not be found it sets an informative diagnostic
 message and calls :command:`return` to end processing of the calling
 package configuration file and return to the :command:`find_package`
 command that loaded it.

 .. note::

   The call to :command:`return` makes this macro unsuitable to call
   from :ref:`Find Modules`.

CMakeFindFrameworks
-------------------

helper module to find OSX frameworks

This module reads hints about search locations from variables::

 CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK_EXTRA_LOCATIONS - Extra directories

CMakeFindPackageMode
--------------------



This file is executed by cmake when invoked with --find-package.  It
expects that the following variables are set using -D:

``NAME``
  name of the package
``COMPILER_ID``
  the CMake compiler ID for which the result is,
  i.e. GNU/Intel/Clang/MSVC, etc.
``LANGUAGE``
  language for which the result will be used,
  i.e. C/CXX/Fortran/ASM
``MODE``
  ``EXIST``
    only check for existence of the given package
  ``COMPILE``
    print the flags needed for compiling an object file which uses
    the given package
  ``LINK``
    print the flags needed for linking when using the given package
``QUIET``
  if TRUE, don't print anything

CMakeGraphVizOptions
--------------------

The builtin graphviz support of CMake.

Variables specific to the graphviz support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMake
can generate graphviz files, showing the dependencies between the
targets in a project and also external libraries which are linked
against.  When CMake is run with the ``--graphviz=foo.dot`` option, it will
produce:

* a ``foo.dot`` file showing all dependencies in the project
* a ``foo.dot.<target>`` file for each target, file showing on which other targets the respective target depends
* a ``foo.dot.<target>.dependers`` file, showing which other targets depend on the respective target

The different dependency types ``PUBLIC``, ``PRIVATE`` and ``INTERFACE``
are represented as solid, dashed and dotted edges.

This can result in huge graphs.  Using the file
``CMakeGraphVizOptions.cmake`` the look and content of the generated
graphs can be influenced.  This file is searched first in
``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`` and then in ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``.  If found, it is
read and the variables set in it are used to adjust options for the
generated graphviz files.

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_TYPE

 The graph type.

 * Mandatory : NO

CMakePackageConfigHelpers
-------------------------

Helpers functions for creating config files that can be included by other
projects to find and use a package.

Adds the ``configure_package_config_file()`` and
``write_basic_package_version_file()`` commands.

Generating a Package Configuration File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: configure_package_config_file

 Create a config file for a project::

 configure_package_config_file(<input> <output>
   INSTALL_DESTINATION <path>
   [PATH_VARS <var1> <var2> ... <varN>]
   [NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO]
   [NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO]
   [INSTALL_PREFIX <path>]
   )

``configure_package_config_file()`` should be used instead of the plain
``configure_file()`` command when creating the ``<PackageName>Config.cmake``
or ``<PackageName>-config.cmake`` file for installing a project or library.
It helps making the resulting package relocatable by avoiding hardcoded paths
in the installed ``Config.cmake`` file.

In a ``FooConfig.cmake`` file there may be code like this to make the install
destinations know to the using project:

 set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_INCLUDEDIR@" )
 set(FOO_DATA_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@RELATIVE_DATA_INSTALL_DIR@" )
 set(FOO_ICONS_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/icons" )
 #...logic to determine installedPrefix from the own location...
 set(FOO_CONFIG_DIR  "${installedPrefix}/@CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@" )

All 4 options shown above are not sufficient, since the first 3 hardcode the
absolute directory locations, and the 4th case works only if the logic to
determine the ``installedPrefix`` is correct, and if ``CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR``
contains a relative path, which in general cannot be guaranteed.  This has the
effect that the resulting ``FooConfig.cmake`` file would work poorly under
Windows and OSX, where users are used to choose the install location of a
binary package at install time, independent from how
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` was set at build/cmake time.

Using ``configure_package_config_file`` helps.  If used correctly, it makes
the resulting ``FooConfig.cmake`` file relocatable.  Usage:

1. write a ``FooConfig.cmake.in`` file as you are used to
2. insert a line containing only the string ``@PACKAGE_INIT@``
3. instead of ``set(FOO_DIR "@SOME_INSTALL_DIR@")``, use
   ``set(FOO_DIR "@PACKAGE_SOME_INSTALL_DIR@")`` (this must be after the
   ``@PACKAGE_INIT@`` line)
4. instead of using the normal ``configure_file()``, use
   ``configure_package_config_file()``



The ``<input>`` and ``<output>`` arguments are the input and output file, the
same way as in ``configure_file()``.

The ``<path>`` given to ``INSTALL_DESTINATION`` must be the destination where
the ``FooConfig.cmake`` file will be installed to.  This path can either be
absolute, or relative to the ``INSTALL_PREFIX`` path.

The variables ``<var1>`` to ``<varN>`` given as ``PATH_VARS`` are the
variables which contain install destinations.  For each of them the macro will
create a helper variable ``PACKAGE_<var...>``.  These helper variables must be
used in the ``FooConfig.cmake.in`` file for setting the installed location.
They are calculated by ``configure_package_config_file`` so that they are
always relative to the installed location of the package.  This works both for
relative and also for absolute locations.  For absolute locations it works
only if the absolute location is a subdirectory of ``INSTALL_PREFIX``.

If the ``INSTALL_PREFIX`` argument is passed, this is used as base path to
calculate all the relative paths.  The ``<path>`` argument must be an absolute
path.  If this argument is not passed, the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``
variable will be used instead.  The default value is good when generating a
FooConfig.cmake file to use your package from the install tree.  When
generating a FooConfig.cmake file to use your package from the build tree this
option should be used.

By default ``configure_package_config_file`` also generates two helper macros,
``set_and_check()`` and ``check_required_components()`` into the
``FooConfig.cmake`` file.

``set_and_check()`` should be used instead of the normal ``set()`` command for
setting directories and file locations.  Additionally to setting the variable
it also checks that the referenced file or directory actually exists and fails
with a ``FATAL_ERROR`` otherwise.  This makes sure that the created
``FooConfig.cmake`` file does not contain wrong references.
When using the ``NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO``, this macro is not generated
into the ``FooConfig.cmake`` file.

``check_required_components(<PackageName>)`` should be called at the end of
the ``FooConfig.cmake`` file. This macro checks whether all requested,
non-optional components have been found, and if this is not the case, sets
the ``Foo_FOUND`` variable to ``FALSE``, so that the package is considered to
be not found.  It does that by testing the ``Foo_<Component>_FOUND``
variables for all requested required components.  This macro should be
called even if the package doesn't provide any components to make sure
users are not specifying components erroneously.  When using the
``NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO`` option, this macro is not generated
into the ``FooConfig.cmake`` file.

For an example see below the documentation for
``write_basic_package_version_file()``.

Generating a Package Version File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: write_basic_package_version_file

 Create a version file for a project::

 write_basic_package_version_file(<filename>
   [VERSION <major.minor.patch>]
   COMPATIBILITY <AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|SameMinorVersion|ExactVersion>
   [ARCH_INDEPENDENT] )

Writes a file for use as ``<PackageName>ConfigVersion.cmake`` file to
``<filename>``.  See the documentation of ``find_package()`` for
details on this.

``<filename>`` is the output filename, it should be in the build tree.
``<major.minor.patch>`` is the version number of the project to be installed.

If no ``VERSION`` is given, the ``PROJECT_VERSION`` variable is used.
If this hasn't been set, it errors out.

The ``COMPATIBILITY`` mode ``AnyNewerVersion`` means that the installed
package version will be considered compatible if it is newer or exactly the
same as the requested version.  This mode should be used for packages which
are fully backward compatible, also across major versions.
If ``SameMajorVersion`` is used instead, then the behaviour differs from
``AnyNewerVersion`` in that the major version number must be the same as
requested, e.g.  version 2.0 will not be considered compatible if 1.0 is
requested.  This mode should be used for packages which guarantee backward
compatibility within the same major version.
If ``SameMinorVersion`` is used, the behaviour is the same as
``SameMajorVersion``, but both major and minor version must be the same as
requested, e.g version 0.2 will not be compatible if 0.1 is requested.
If ``ExactVersion`` is used, then the package is only considered compatible if
the requested version matches exactly its own version number (not considering
the tweak version).  For example, version 1.2.3 of a package is only
considered compatible to requested version 1.2.3.  This mode is for packages
without compatibility guarantees.
If your project has more elaborated version matching rules, you will need to
write your own custom ``ConfigVersion.cmake`` file instead of using this
macro.

If ``ARCH_INDEPENDENT`` is given, the installed package version will be
considered compatible even if it was built for a different architecture than
the requested architecture.  Otherwise, an architecture check will be performed,
and the package will be considered compatible only if the architecture matches
exactly.  For example, if the package is built for a 32-bit architecture, the
package is only considered compatible if it is used on a 32-bit architecture,
unless ``ARCH_INDEPENDENT`` is given, in which case the package is considered
compatible on any architecture.

.. note:: ``ARCH_INDEPENDENT`` is intended for header-only libraries or similar
   packages with no binaries.

Internally, this macro executes ``configure_file()`` to create the
resulting version file.  Depending on the ``COMPATIBILITY``, the corresponding
``BasicConfigVersion-<COMPATIBILITY>.cmake.in`` file is used.
Please note that these files are internal to CMake and you should not call
``configure_file()`` on them yourself, but they can be used as starting
point to create more sophisticted custom ``ConfigVersion.cmake`` files.

Example Generating Package Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example using both ``configure_package_config_file()`` and
``write_basic_package_version_file()``:

``CMakeLists.txt``:

 set(INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR include/ ... CACHE )
 set(LIB_INSTALL_DIR lib/ ... CACHE )
 set(SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR etc/foo/ ... CACHE )
 #...
 include(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)
 configure_package_config_file(FooConfig.cmake.in
   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake
   INSTALL_DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake
   PATH_VARS INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR)
 write_basic_package_version_file(
   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
   VERSION 1.2.3
   COMPATIBILITY SameMajorVersion )
 install(FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake
               ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
         DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake )

``FooConfig.cmake.in``:

::

 set(FOO_VERSION x.y.z)
 ...
 @PACKAGE_INIT@
 ...
 set_and_check(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR "@PACKAGE_INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR@")
 set_and_check(FOO_SYSCONFIG_DIR "@PACKAGE_SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@")

 check_required_components(Foo)

CMakePrintHelpers
-----------------

Convenience functions for printing properties and variables, useful
e.g. for debugging.

::

 cmake_print_properties([TARGETS target1 ..  targetN]
                       [SOURCES source1 .. sourceN]
                       [DIRECTORIES dir1 .. dirN]
                       [TESTS test1 .. testN]
                       [CACHE_ENTRIES entry1 .. entryN]
                       PROPERTIES prop1 .. propN )

This function prints the values of the properties of the given targets,
source files, directories, tests or cache entries.  Exactly one of the
scope keywords must be used.  Example::

 cmake_print_properties(TARGETS foo bar PROPERTIES
                        LOCATION INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRS)

This will print the LOCATION and INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRS properties for
both targets foo and bar.

::

 cmake_print_variables(var1 var2 ..  varN)

This function will print the name of each variable followed by its value.
Example::

 cmake_print_variables(CMAKE_C_COMPILER CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION DOES_NOT_EXIST)

Gives::

 -- CMAKE_C_COMPILER="/usr/bin/gcc" ; CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION="2" ; DOES_NOT_EXIST=""

CMakePrintSystemInformation
---------------------------

print system information

This file can be used for diagnostic purposes just include it in a
project to see various internal CMake variables.

CMakePushCheckState
-------------------



This module defines three macros: ``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()``
``CMAKE_POP_CHECK_STATE()`` and ``CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()`` These macros can
be used to save, restore and reset (i.e., clear contents) the state of
the variables ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``, ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``,
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``, ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``,
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES`` and ``CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES`` used by the
various Check-files coming with CMake, like e.g. ``check_function_exists()``
etc.
The variable contents are pushed on a stack, pushing multiple times is
supported.  This is useful e.g.  when executing such tests in a Find-module,
where they have to be set, but after the Find-module has been executed they
should have the same value as they had before.

``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()`` macro receives optional argument ``RESET``.
Whether it's specified, ``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()`` will set all
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_*`` variables to empty values, same as
``CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()`` call will do.

Usage:

 cmake_push_check_state(RESET)
 set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS -DSOME_MORE_DEF)
 check_function_exists(...)
 cmake_reset_check_state()
 set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS -DANOTHER_DEF)
 check_function_exists(...)
 cmake_pop_check_state()

CMakeVerifyManifest
-------------------



CMakeVerifyManifest.cmake

This script is used to verify that embedded manifests and side by side
manifests for a project match.  To run this script, cd to a directory
and run the script with cmake -P.  On the command line you can pass in
versions that are OK even if not found in the .manifest files.  For
example, cmake -Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0
-PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake could be used to allow an embedded manifest
of 8.0.50608.0 to be used in a project even if that version was not
found in the .manifest file.

CPackComponent
--------------

Build binary and source package installers

Variables concerning CPack Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CPackComponent module is the module which handles the component
part of CPack.  See CPack module for general information about CPack.

For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical
installers on macOS and Windows), CPack generates installers that
allow users to select individual application components to install.
The contents of each of the components are identified by the COMPONENT
argument of CMake's INSTALL command.  These components can be
annotated with user-friendly names and descriptions, inter-component
dependencies, etc., and grouped in various ways to customize the
resulting installer.  See the cpack_add_* commands, described below,
for more information about component-specific installations.

Component-specific installation allows users to select specific sets
of components to install during the install process.  Installation
components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of CMake's INSTALL
commands, and should be further described by the following CPack
commands:

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL

 The list of component to install.

 The default value of this variable is computed by CPack and contains all
 components defined by the project.  The user may set it to only include the
 specified components.

 Instead of specifying all the desired components, it is possible to obtain a
 list of all defined components and then remove the unwanted ones from the
 list. The ``get_cmake_property()`` command can be used to obtain the
 ``COMPONENTS`` property, then the ``list(REMOVE_ITEM)`` command can be
 used to remove the unwanted ones. For example, to use all defined components
 except ``foo`` and ``bar``::

 get_cmake_property(CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL COMPONENTS)
 list(REMOVE_ITEM CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL "foo" "bar")

.. variable:: CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL

 Enable/Disable component install for CPack generator <GENNAME>.

 Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG, etc...) has a legacy
 default behavior.  e.g.  RPM builds monolithic whereas NSIS builds
 component.  One can change the default behavior by setting this variable to
 0/1 or OFF/ON.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING

 Specify how components are grouped for multi-package component-aware CPack
 generators.

 Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE family (TGZ, ZIP, ...) generates
 several packages files when asked for component packaging.  They group
 the component differently depending on the value of this variable:

 * ONE_PER_GROUP (default): creates one package file per component group
 * ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : creates a single package with all (requested) components
 * IGNORE : creates one package per component, i.e. IGNORE component group

 One can specify different grouping for different CPack generator by
 using a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DISPLAY_NAME

 The name to be displayed for a component.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DESCRIPTION

 The description of a component.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_GROUP

 The group of a component.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DEPENDS

 The dependencies (list of components) on which this component depends.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_HIDDEN

 True if this component is hidden from the user.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_REQUIRED

 True if this component is required.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DISABLED

 True if this component is not selected to be installed by default.

.. command:: cpack_add_component

Describes a CPack installation
component named by the COMPONENT argument to a CMake INSTALL command.

::

 cpack_add_component(compname
                     [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                     [DESCRIPTION description]
                     [HIDDEN | REQUIRED | DISABLED ]
                     [GROUP group]
                     [DEPENDS comp1 comp2 ... ]
                     [INSTALL_TYPES type1 type2 ... ]
                     [DOWNLOADED]
                     [ARCHIVE_FILE filename]
                     [PLIST filename])

The cmake_add_component command describes an installation component,
which the user can opt to install or remove as part of the graphical
installation process.  compname is the name of the component, as
provided to the COMPONENT argument of one or more CMake INSTALL
commands.

DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component, used in graphical
installers to display the component name.  This value can be any
string.

DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component, used in
graphical installers to give the user additional information about the
component.  Descriptions can span multiple lines using ``\n`` as the
line separator.  Typically, these descriptions should be no more than
a few lines long.

HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in the graphical
installer, so that the user cannot directly change whether it is
installed or not.

REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore will
always be installed.  It will be visible in the graphical installer,
but it cannot be unselected.  (Typically, required components are
shown greyed out).

DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled (unselected)
by default.  The user is free to select this component for
installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.

DEPENDS lists the components on which this component depends.  If this
component is selected, then each of the components listed must also be
selected.  The dependency information is encoded within the installer
itself, so that users cannot install inconsistent sets of components.

GROUP names the component group of which this component is a part.  If
not provided, the component will be a standalone component, not part
of any component group.  Component groups are described with the
cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.

INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this component is
a part.  When one of these installations types is selected, this
component will automatically be selected.  Installation types are
described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.

DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be downloaded
on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged in with the
installer itself.  For more information, see the
cpack_configure_downloads command.

ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack to
be used for downloaded components.  If not supplied, CPack will create
a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and the name of
the component.  See cpack_configure_downloads for more information.

PLIST gives a filename that is passed to pkgbuild with the
``--component-plist`` argument when using the productbuild generator.

.. command:: cpack_add_component_group

Describes a group of related CPack installation components.

::

 cpack_add_component_group(groupname
                          [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                          [DESCRIPTION description]
                          [PARENT_GROUP parent]
                          [EXPANDED]
                          [BOLD_TITLE])

The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation
components, which will be placed together within the listing of
options.  Typically, component groups allow the user to
select/deselect all of the components within a single group via a
single group-level option.  Use component groups to reduce the
complexity of installers with many options.  groupname is an arbitrary
name used to identify the group in the GROUP argument of the
cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a component in a
group.  The name of the group must not conflict with the name of any
component.

DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component group, used in
graphical installers to display the component group name.  This value
can be any string.

DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component group, used in
graphical installers to give the user additional information about the
components within that group.  Descriptions can span multiple lines
using ``\n`` as the line separator.  Typically, these descriptions
should be no more than a few lines long.

PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of this group.
Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy of groups, providing
an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.

EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should show up as
"expanded", so that the user immediately sees all of the components
within the group.  Otherwise, the group will initially show up as a
single entry.

BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear in bold, to
call the user's attention to the group.

.. command:: cpack_add_install_type

Add a new installation type containing
a set of predefined component selections to the graphical installer.

::

 cpack_add_install_type(typename
                        [DISPLAY_NAME name])

The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of preselected
components that represents a common use case for an application.  For
example, a "Developer" install type might include an application along
with its header and library files, while an "End user" install type
might just include the application's executable.  Each component
identifies itself with one or more install types via the INSTALL_TYPES
argument to cpack_add_component.

DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type, which will
typically show up in a drop-down box within a graphical installer.
This value can be any string.

.. command:: cpack_configure_downloads

Configure CPack to download
selected components on-the-fly as part of the installation process.

::

 cpack_configure_downloads(site
                           [UPLOAD_DIRECTORY dirname]
                           [ALL]
                           [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])

The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation-time
downloads of selected components.  For each downloadable component,
CPack will create an archive containing the contents of that
component, which should be uploaded to the given site.  When the user
selects that component for installation, the installer will download
and extract the component in place.  This feature is useful for
creating small installers that only download the requested components,
saving bandwidth.  Additionally, the installers are small enough that
they will be installed as part of the normal installation process, and
the "Change" button in Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will
allow one to add or remove parts of the application after the original
installation.  On Windows, the downloaded-components functionality
requires the ZipDLL plug-in for NSIS, available at:

::

 http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in

On macOS, installers that download components on-the-fly can only
be built and installed on system using macOS 10.5 or later.

The site argument is a URL where the archives for downloadable
components will reside, e.g.,
https://cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/ All of the archives
produced by CPack should be uploaded to that location.

UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will create the
various archives for each of the components.  The contents of this
directory should be uploaded to a location accessible by the URL given
in the site argument.  If omitted, CPack will use the directory
CPackUploads inside the CMake binary directory to store the generated
archives.

The ALL flag indicates that all components be downloaded.  Otherwise,
only those components explicitly marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a
specified ARCHIVE_FILE will be downloaded.  Additionally, the ALL
option implies ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).

ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of the installer
that can be called from Windows' Add/Remove Programs dialog (via the
"Modify" button) to change the set of installed components.
NO_ADD_REMOVE turns off this behavior.  This option is ignored on Mac
OS X.

CPackIFW
--------

The documentation for the CPack IFW generator has moved here: ``CPack IFW Generator``

This module looks for the location of the command line utilities supplied
with the Qt Installer Framework (QtIFW_).

The module also defines several commands to control the behavior of the
CPack ``IFW`` generator.

Commands
^^^^^^^^

The module defines the following commands:

.. command:: cpack_ifw_configure_component

  Sets the arguments specific to the CPack IFW generator.

  ::

   cpack_ifw_configure_component(<compname> [COMMON] [ESSENTIAL] [VIRTUAL]
                       [FORCED_INSTALLATION] [REQUIRES_ADMIN_RIGHTS]
                       [NAME <name>]
                       [DISPLAY_NAME <display_name>] # Note: Internationalization supported

CPackIFWConfigureFile
---------------------

The module defines ``configure_file()`` similar command to
configure file templates prepared in QtIFW/SDK/Creator style.


Commands
^^^^^^^^

The module defines the following commands:

.. command:: cpack_ifw_configure_file

  Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

  ::

   cpack_ifw_configure_file(<input> <output>)

 Copies an ``<input>`` file to an ``<output>`` file and substitutes variable
 values referenced as ``%{VAR}`` or ``%VAR%`` in the input file content.
 Each variable reference will be replaced with the current value of the
 variable, or the empty string if the variable is not defined.

CPack
-----

Build binary and source package installers.

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CPack module generates a file ``CPackConfig.cmake`` intended for
use in a subsequent run of  the ``cpack`` program
where it steers the generation of installers or/and source packages.

Inclusion of the CPack module adds two new build targets, ``package``
and ``package_source``, which build the binary and source installers
respectively.  The generated binary installers contain everything
installed via CMake's ``install()`` command (and the deprecated
commands ``install_files()``, ``install_programs()``, and
``install_targets()``).

For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical
installers on macOS and Windows), CPack generates installers that
allow users to select individual application components to install.
See ``CPackComponent`` module for further details.

CPack Generators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` variable has different meanings in different
contexts.  In a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` is a
*list of generators*: and when ``cpack`` is run with no other
arguments, it will iterate over that list and produce one package for each
generator.  In a ``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE``,
``CPACK_GENERATOR`` is a *string naming a single generator*.  If you
need per-cpack-generator logic to control *other* cpack settings, then you
need a ``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE``.

The CMake source tree itself contains a ``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE``.
See the top level file ``CMakeCPackOptions.cmake.in`` for an example.

If set, the ``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE`` is included automatically
on a per-generator basis.  It only need contain overrides.

Here's how it works:

* ``cpack`` runs
* it includes ``CPackConfig.cmake``
* it iterates over the generators given by the ``-G`` command line option,
  or if no such option was specified, over the list of generators given by
  the ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` variable set in the ``CPackConfig.cmake``
  input file.
* foreach generator, it then

  - sets ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` to the one currently being iterated
  - includes the ``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE``
  - produces the package for that generator

This is the key: For each generator listed in ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` in
``CPackConfig.cmake``, cpack will *reset* ``CPACK_GENERATOR``
internally to *the one currently being used* and then include the
``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE``.

Variables common to all CPack Generators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before including this CPack module in your ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, there
are a variety of variables that can be set to customize the resulting
installers.  The most commonly-used variables are:

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME

  The name of the package (or application).  If not specified, it defaults to
  the project name.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR

  The name of the package vendor. (e.g., "Kitware").  The default is "Humanity".

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY

  The directory in which CPack is doing its packaging.  If it is not set
  then this will default (internally) to the build dir.  This variable may
  be defined in a CPack config file or from the ``cpack``
  command line option ``-B``.  If set, the command line option overrides the
  value found in the config file.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR

  Package major version.  This variable will always be set, but its default
  value depends on whether or not version details were given to the
  ``project()`` command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file.  If version
  details were given, the default value will be
  ``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR``.  If no version details were given,
  a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR`` having a default value of 0.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR

  Package minor version.  The default value is determined based on whether or
  not version details were given to the ``project()`` command in the top
  level CMakeLists.txt file.  If version details were given, the default
  value will be ``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR``, but if no minor
  version component was specified then ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR`` will be
  left unset.  If no project version was given at all, a default version of
  0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR`` having a
  default value of 1.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH

  Package patch version.  The default value is determined based on whether or
  not version details were given to the ``project()`` command in the top
  level CMakeLists.txt file.  If version details were given, the default
  value will be ``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH``, but if no patch
  version component was specified then ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH`` will be
  left unset.  If no project version was given at all, a default version of
  0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH`` having a
  default value of 1.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION

  A description of the project, used in places such as the introduction
  screen of CPack-generated Windows installers.  If not set, the value of
  this variable is populated from the file named by
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE

  A text file used to describe the project when
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION`` is not explicitly set.  The default
  value for ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE`` points to a built-in template
  file ``Templates/CPack.GenericDescription.txt``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY

  Short description of the project (only a few words).  If the
  ``CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`` variable is set, it is used as the
  default value, otherwise the default will be a string generated by CMake
  based on ``CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE_URL

  Project homepage URL.  The default value is taken from the
  ``CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL`` variable, which is set by the top
  level ``project()`` command, or else the default will be empty if no
  URL was provided to ``project()``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME

  The name of the package file to generate, not including the
  extension.  For example, ``cmake-2.6.1-Linux-i686``.  The default value
  is::

 ${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}-${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}-${CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME}

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY

  Installation directory on the target system. This may be used by some
  CPack generators like NSIS to create an installation directory e.g.,
  "CMake 2.5" below the installation prefix.  All installed elements will be
  put inside this directory.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON

  A branding image that will be displayed inside the installer (used by GUI
  installers).

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM

  An algorithm that will be used to generate an additional file with the
  checksum of the package.  The output file name will be::

   ${CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME}.${CPACK_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM}

 Supported algorithms are those listed by the
 :ref:`string(\<HASH\>) <Supported Hash Algorithms>` command.

.. variable:: CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE

  CPack-time project CPack configuration file.  This file is included at cpack
  time, once per generator after CPack has set ``CPACK_GENERATOR``
  to the actual generator being used.  It allows per-generator setting of
  ``CPACK_*`` variables at cpack time.

.. variable:: CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE

  License to be embedded in the installer.  It will typically be displayed
  to the user by the produced installer (often with an explicit "Accept"
  button, for graphical installers) prior to installation.  This license
  file is NOT added to the installed files but is used by some CPack generators
  like NSIS.  If you want to install a license file (may be the same as this
  one) along with your project, you must add an appropriate CMake
  ``install()`` command in your ``CMakeLists.txt``.

.. variable:: CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README

  ReadMe file to be embedded in the installer.  It typically describes in
  some detail the purpose of the project during the installation.  Not all
  CPack generators use this file.

.. variable:: CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME

  Welcome file to be embedded in the installer.  It welcomes users to this
  installer.  Typically used in the graphical installers on Windows and Mac
  OS X.

.. variable:: CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL

  Disables the component-based installation mechanism.  When set, the
  component specification is ignored and all installed items are put in a
  single "MONOLITHIC" package.  Some CPack generators do monolithic
  packaging by default and may be asked to do component packaging by
  setting ``CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL`` to ``TRUE``.

.. variable:: CPACK_GENERATOR

  List of CPack generators to use.  If not specified, CPack will create a
  set of options following the naming pattern
  ``CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME>`` (e.g. ``CPACK_BINARY_NSIS``) allowing
  the user to enable/disable individual generators.  If the ``-G`` option is
  given on the ``cpack`` command line, it will override this
  variable and any ``CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME>`` options.

.. variable:: CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE

  The name of the CPack binary configuration file.  This file is the CPack
  configuration generated by the CPack module for binary installers.
  Defaults to ``CPackConfig.cmake``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES

  Lists each of the executables and associated text label to be used to
  create Start Menu shortcuts.  For example, setting this to the list
  ``ccmake;CMake`` will create a shortcut named "CMake" that will execute the
  installed executable ``ccmake``.  Not all CPack generators use it (at least
  NSIS, WIX and OSXX11 do).

.. variable:: CPACK_STRIP_FILES

  List of files to be stripped.  Starting with CMake 2.6.0,
  ``CPACK_STRIP_FILES`` will be a boolean variable which enables
  stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to ``TRUE`` in CMake,
  so this change is compatible).

.. variable:: CPACK_VERBATIM_VARIABLES

  If set to ``TRUE``, values of variables prefixed with ``CPACK_`` will be
  escaped before being written to the configuration files, so that the cpack
  program receives them exactly as they were specified.  If not, characters
  like quotes and backslashes can cause parsing errors or alter the value
  received by the cpack program.  Defaults to ``FALSE`` for backwards
  compatibility.

Variables for Source Package Generators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following CPack variables are specific to source packages, and
will not affect binary packages:

.. variable:: CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME

  The name of the source package.  For example ``cmake-2.6.1``.

.. variable:: CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES

  List of files in the source tree that will be stripped.  Starting with
  CMake 2.6.0, ``CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES`` will be a boolean
  variable which enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates
  to ``TRUE`` in CMake, so this change is compatible).

.. variable:: CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR

  List of generators used for the source packages.  As with
  ``CPACK_GENERATOR``, if this is not specified then CPack will
  create a set of options (e.g. ``CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP``) allowing
  users to select which packages will be generated.

.. variable:: CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE

  The name of the CPack source configuration file.  This file is the CPack
  configuration generated by the CPack module for source installers.
  Defaults to ``CPackSourceConfig.cmake``.

.. variable:: CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES

  Pattern of files in the source tree that won't be packaged when building
  a source package.  This is a list of regular expression patterns (that
  must be properly escaped), e.g.,
  ``/CVS/;/\\.svn/;\\.swp$;\\.#;/#;.*~;cscope.*``

Variables for Advanced Use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following variables are for advanced uses of CPack:

.. variable:: CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR

  What CMake generator should be used if the project is a CMake
  project.  Defaults to the value of ``CMAKE_GENERATOR``.  Few users
  will want to change this setting.

.. variable:: CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS

  List of four values that specify what project to install.  The four values
  are: Build directory, Project Name, Project Component, Directory.  If
  omitted, CPack will build an installer that installs everything.

.. variable:: CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME

  System name, defaults to the value of ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME``,
  except on Windows where it will be ``win32`` or ``win64``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION

  Package full version, used internally.  By default, this is built from
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR``,
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR``, and
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH``.

.. variable:: CPACK_TOPLEVEL_TAG

  Directory for the installed files.

.. variable:: CPACK_INSTALL_COMMANDS

  Extra commands to install components.

.. variable:: CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES

  Extra directories to install.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY

  Registry key used when installing this project.  This is only used by
  installers for Windows.  The default value is based on the installation
  directory.

.. variable:: CPACK_CREATE_DESKTOP_LINKS

  List of desktop links to create.  Each desktop link requires a
  corresponding start menu shortcut as created by
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES``.

.. variable:: CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME>

  CPack generated options for binary generators.  The ``CPack.cmake`` module
  generates (when ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` is not set) a set of CMake
  options (see CMake ``option()`` command) which may then be used to
  select the CPack generator(s) to be used when building the ``package``
  target or when running ``cpack`` without the ``-G`` option.


CSharpUtilities
---------------

Functions to make configuration of CSharp/.NET targets easier.

A collection of CMake utility functions useful for dealing with CSharp
targets for Visual Studio generators from version 2010 and later.

The following functions are provided by this module:

**Main functions**

- ``csharp_set_windows_forms_properties()``
- ``csharp_set_designer_cs_properties()``
- ``csharp_set_xaml_cs_properties()``

**Helper functions**

- ``csharp_get_filename_keys()``
- ``csharp_get_filename_key_base()``
- ``csharp_get_dependentupon_name()``

Main functions provided by the module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: csharp_set_windows_forms_properties

  Sets source file properties for use of Windows Forms. Use this, if your CSharp
  target uses Windows Forms::

   csharp_set_windows_forms_properties([<file1> [<file2> [...]]])

 ``<fileN>``
   List of all source files which are relevant for setting the
   :prop_sf:`VS_CSHARP_<tagname>` properties (including ``.cs``, ``.resx`` and
   ``.Designer.cs`` extensions).

 In the list of all given files for all files ending with ``.Designer.cs`` and
 ``.resx`` is searched.  For every *designer* or *resource* file a file with the
 same base name but only ``.cs`` as extension is searched.  If this is found, the
 :prop_sf:`VS_CSHARP_<tagname>` properties are set as follows:

 for the **.cs** file:
  - VS_CSHARP_SubType "Form"

 for the **.Designer.cs** file (if it exists):
  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <cs-filename>
  - VS_CSHARP_DesignTime "" (delete tag if previously defined)
  - VS_CSHARP_AutoGen ""(delete tag if previously defined)

 for the **.resx** file (if it exists):
  - VS_RESOURCE_GENERATOR "" (delete tag if previously defined)
  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <cs-filename>
  - VS_CSHARP_SubType "Designer"

.. command:: csharp_set_designer_cs_properties

  Sets source file properties of ``.Designer.cs`` files depending on
  sibling filenames. Use this, if your CSharp target does **not**
  use Windows Forms (for Windows Forms use
  ``csharp_set_designer_cs_properties()`` instead)::

   csharp_set_designer_cs_properties([<file1> [<file2> [...]]])

 ``<fileN>``
   List of all source files which are relevant for setting the
   :prop_sf:`VS_CSHARP_<tagname>` properties (including ``.cs``,
   ``.resx``, ``.settings`` and ``.Designer.cs`` extensions).

 In the list of all given files for all files ending with
 ``.Designer.cs`` is searched. For every *designer* file all files
 with the same base name but different extensions are searched. If
 a match is found, the source file properties of the *designer* file
 are set depending on the extension of the matched file:

 if match is **.resx** file:
  - VS_CSHARP_AutoGen "True"
  - VS_CSHARP_DesignTime "True"
  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <resx-filename>

 if match is **.cs** file:
  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <cs-filename>

 if match is **.settings** file:
  - VS_CSHARP_AutoGen "True"
  - VS_CSHARP_DesignTimeSharedInput "True"
  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <settings-filename>

.. note::

    Because the source file properties of the ``.Designer.cs`` file are set according
    to the found matches and every match sets the **VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon**
    property, there should only be one match for each ``Designer.cs`` file.

.. command:: csharp_set_xaml_cs_properties

  Sets source file properties for use of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and
  XAML. Use this, if your CSharp target uses WPF/XAML::

   csharp_set_xaml_cs_properties([<file1> [<file2> [...]]])

 ``<fileN>``
   List of all source files which are relevant for setting the
   :prop_sf:`VS_CSHARP_<tagname>` properties (including ``.cs``,
   ``.xaml``, and ``.xaml.cs`` extensions).

 In the list of all given files for all files ending with
 ``.xaml.cs`` is searched. For every *xaml-cs* file, a file
 with the same base name but extension ``.xaml`` is searched.
 If a match is found, the source file properties of the ``.xaml.cs``
 file are set:

  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <xaml-filename>

Helper functions which are used by the above ones
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: csharp_get_filename_keys

  Helper function which computes a list of key values to identify
  source files independently of relative/absolute paths given in cmake
  and eliminates case sensitivity::

   csharp_get_filename_keys(OUT [<file1> [<file2> [...]]])

 ``OUT``
   Name of the variable in which the list of keys is stored

 ``<fileN>``
   filename(s) as given to to CSharp target using :command:`add_library`
   or :command:`add_executable`

 In some way the function applies a canonicalization to the source names.
 This is necessary to find file matches if the files have been added to
 the target with different directory prefixes:

 .. code-block:: cmake

   add_library(lib
     myfile.cs
     ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/myfile.Designer.cs)

   set_source_files_properties(myfile.Designer.cs PROPERTIES
     VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon myfile.cs)

   # this will fail, because in cmake
   #  - ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/myfile.Designer.cs
   #  - myfile.Designer.cs
   # are not the same source file. The source file property is not set.

.. command:: csharp_get_filename_key_base

  Returns the full filepath and name **without** extension of a key.
  KEY is expected to be a key from csharp_get_filename_keys. In BASE
  the value of KEY without the file extension is returned::

   csharp_get_filename_key_base(BASE KEY)

 ``BASE``
   Name of the variable with the computed "base" of ``KEY``.

 ``KEY``
   The key of which the base will be computed. Expected to be a
   upper case full filename.

.. command:: csharp_get_dependentupon_name

  Computes a string which can be used as value for the source file property
  ``VS_CSHARP_<tagname>`` with *target* being ``DependentUpon``::

   csharp_get_dependentupon_name(NAME FILE)

 ``NAME``
   Name of the variable with the result value

 ``FILE``
   Filename to convert to ``<DependentUpon>`` value

 Actually this is only the filename without any path given at the moment.

CTest
-----

Configure a project for testing with CTest/CDash

Include this module in the top CMakeLists.txt file of a project to
enable testing with CTest and dashboard submissions to CDash::

 project(MyProject)
 ...
 include(CTest)

The module automatically creates a ``BUILD_TESTING`` option that selects
whether to enable testing support (``ON`` by default).  After including
the module, use code like::

 if(BUILD_TESTING)
   # ... CMake code to create tests ...
 endif()

to creating tests when testing is enabled.

To enable submissions to a CDash server, create a ``CTestConfig.cmake``
file at the top of the project with content such as::

 set(CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME "01:00:00 UTC")
 set(CTEST_SUBMIT_URL "http://my.cdash.org/submit.php?project=MyProject")

(the CDash server can provide the file to a project administrator who
configures ``MyProject``).  Settings in the config file are shared by
both this ``CTest`` module and the ``ctest(1)`` command-line
:ref:`Dashboard Client` mode (``ctest -S``).

While building a project for submission to CDash, CTest scans the
build output for errors and warnings and reports them with surrounding
context from the build log.  This generic approach works for all build
tools, but does not give details about the command invocation that
produced a given problem.  One may get more detailed reports by setting
the ``CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS`` variable::

 set(CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS 1)

in the ``CTestConfig.cmake`` file.

CTestCoverageCollectGCOV
------------------------

This module provides the ``ctest_coverage_collect_gcov`` function.

This function runs gcov on all .gcda files found in the binary tree
and packages the resulting .gcov files into a tar file.
This tarball also contains the following:

* *data.json* defines the source and build directories for use by CDash.
* *Labels.json* indicates any ``LABELS`` that have been set on the
  source files.
* The *uncovered* directory holds any uncovered files found by
  ``CTEST_EXTRA_COVERAGE_GLOB``.

After generating this tar file, it can be sent to CDash for display with the
``ctest_submit(CDASH_UPLOAD)`` command.

.. command:: cdash_coverage_collect_gcov

  ::

   ctest_coverage_collect_gcov(TARBALL <tarfile>
     [SOURCE <source_dir>][BUILD <build_dir>]
     [GCOV_COMMAND <gcov_command>]
     [GCOV_OPTIONS <options>...]
     )

 Run gcov and package a tar file for CDash.  The options are:

 ``TARBALL <tarfile>``
   Specify the location of the ``.tar`` file to be created for later
   upload to CDash.  Relative paths will be interpreted with respect
   to the top-level build directory.

 ``SOURCE <source_dir>``
   Specify the top-level source directory for the build.
   Default is the value of :variable:`CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`.

 ``BUILD <build_dir>``
   Specify the top-level build directory for the build.
   Default is the value of :variable:`CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`.

 ``GCOV_COMMAND <gcov_command>``
   Specify the full path to the ``gcov`` command on the machine.
   Default is the value of :variable:`CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND`.

 ``GCOV_OPTIONS <options>...``
   Specify options to be passed to gcov.  The ``gcov`` command
   is run as ``gcov <options>... -o <gcov-dir> <file>.gcda``.
   If not specified, the default option is just ``-b``.

 ``GLOB``
   Recursively search for .gcda files in build_dir rather than
   determining search locations by reading TargetDirectories.txt.

 ``DELETE``
   Delete coverage files after they've been packaged into the .tar.

 ``QUIET``
   Suppress non-error messages that otherwise would have been
   printed out by this function.

CTestScriptMode
---------------



This file is read by ctest in script mode (-S)

CTestUseLaunchers
-----------------

Set the RULE_LAUNCH_* global properties when CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is on.

CTestUseLaunchers is automatically included when you include(CTest).
However, it is split out into its own module file so projects can use
the CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS functionality independently.

To use launchers, set CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS to ON in a ctest -S
dashboard script, and then also set it in the cache of the configured
project.  Both cmake and ctest need to know the value of it for the
launchers to work properly.  CMake needs to know in order to generate
proper build rules, and ctest, in order to produce the proper error
and warning analysis.

For convenience, you may set the ENV variable
CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS_DEFAULT in your ctest -S script, too.  Then, as
long as your CMakeLists uses include(CTest) or
include(CTestUseLaunchers), it will use the value of the ENV variable
to initialize a CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS cache variable.  This cache
variable initialization only occurs if CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is not
already defined. If CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is on in a ctest -S script
the ctest_configure command will add -DCTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS:BOOL=TRUE
to the cmake command used to configure the project.

Dart
----

Configure a project for testing with CTest or old Dart Tcl Client

This file is the backwards-compatibility version of the CTest module.
It supports using the old Dart 1 Tcl client for driving dashboard
submissions as well as testing with CTest.  This module should be
included in the CMakeLists.txt file at the top of a project.  Typical
usage:

::

 include(Dart)
 if(BUILD_TESTING)
   # ... testing related CMake code ...
 endif()

The BUILD_TESTING option is created by the Dart module to determine
whether testing support should be enabled.  The default is ON.

DeployQt4
---------

Functions to help assemble a standalone Qt4 executable.

A collection of CMake utility functions useful for deploying Qt4
executables.

The following functions are provided by this module:

::

 write_qt4_conf
 resolve_qt4_paths
 fixup_qt4_executable
 install_qt4_plugin_path
 install_qt4_plugin
 install_qt4_executable

Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function and
PARENT_SCOPE.  Also depends on BundleUtilities.cmake.

::

 write_qt4_conf(<qt_conf_dir> <qt_conf_contents>)

Writes a qt.conf file with the <qt_conf_contents> into <qt_conf_dir>.

::

 resolve_qt4_paths(<paths_var> [<executable_path>])

Loop through <paths_var> list and if any don't exist resolve them
relative to the <executable_path> (if supplied) or the
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

::

 fixup_qt4_executable(<executable>
   [<qtplugins> <libs> <dirs> <plugins_dir> <request_qt_conf>])

Copies Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if needed) and
fixes up a Qt4 executable using BundleUtilities so it is standalone
and can be drag-and-drop copied to another machine as long as all of
the system libraries are compatible.

<executable> should point to the executable to be fixed-up.

<qtplugins> should contain a list of the names or paths of any Qt
plugins to be installed.

<libs> will be passed to BundleUtilities and should be a list of any
already installed plugins, libraries or executables to also be
fixed-up.

<dirs> will be passed to BundleUtilities and should contain and
directories to be searched to find library dependencies.

<plugins_dir> allows an custom plugins directory to be used.

<request_qt_conf> will force a qt.conf file to be written even if not
needed.

::

 install_qt4_plugin_path(plugin executable copy installed_plugin_path_var
                         <plugins_dir> <component> <configurations>)

Install (or copy) a resolved <plugin> to the default plugins directory
(or <plugins_dir>) relative to <executable> and store the result in
<installed_plugin_path_var>.

If <copy> is set to TRUE then the plugins will be copied rather than
installed.  This is to allow this module to be used at CMake time
rather than install time.

If <component> is set then anything installed will use this COMPONENT.

::

 install_qt4_plugin(plugin executable copy installed_plugin_path_var
                    <plugins_dir> <component>)

Install (or copy) an unresolved <plugin> to the default plugins
directory (or <plugins_dir>) relative to <executable> and store the
result in <installed_plugin_path_var>.  See documentation of
INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN_PATH.

::

 install_qt4_executable(<executable>
   [<qtplugins> <libs> <dirs> <plugins_dir> <request_qt_conf> <component>])

Installs Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if needed) and
fixes up a Qt4 executable using BundleUtilities so it is standalone
and can be drag-and-drop copied to another machine as long as all of
the system libraries are compatible.  The executable will be fixed-up
at install time.  <component> is the COMPONENT used for bundle fixup
and plugin installation.  See documentation of FIXUP_QT4_BUNDLE.

Documentation
-------------

This module provides support for the VTK documentation framework.  It
relies on several tools (Doxygen, Perl, etc).

ExternalData
------------

Manage data files stored outside source tree

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use this module to unambiguously reference data files stored outside
the source tree and fetch them at build time from arbitrary local and
remote content-addressed locations.  Functions provided by this module
recognize arguments with the syntax ``DATA{<name>}`` as references to
external data, replace them with full paths to local copies of those
data, and create build rules to fetch and update the local copies.

For example:

 include(ExternalData)
 set(ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES "file:///local/%(algo)/%(hash)"
                                "file:////host/share/%(algo)/%(hash)"
                                "http://data.org/%(algo)/%(hash)")
 ExternalData_Add_Test(MyData
   NAME MyTest
   COMMAND MyExe DATA{MyInput.png}
   )
 ExternalData_Add_Target(MyData)

When test ``MyTest`` runs the ``DATA{MyInput.png}`` argument will be
replaced by the full path to a real instance of the data file
``MyInput.png`` on disk.  If the source tree contains a content link
such as ``MyInput.png.md5`` then the ``MyData`` target creates a real
``MyInput.png`` in the build tree.

Module Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: ExternalData_Expand_Arguments

  The ``ExternalData_Expand_Arguments`` function evaluates ``DATA{}``
  references in its arguments and constructs a new list of arguments::

   ExternalData_Expand_Arguments(
     <target>   # Name of data management target
     <outVar>   # Output variable
     [args...]  # Input arguments, DATA{} allowed
     )

 It replaces each ``DATA{}`` reference in an argument with the full path of
 a real data file on disk that will exist after the ``<target>`` builds.

.. command:: ExternalData_Add_Test

  The ``ExternalData_Add_Test`` function wraps around the CMake
  ``add_test()`` command but supports ``DATA{}`` references in
  its arguments::

   ExternalData_Add_Test(
     <target>   # Name of data management target
     ...        # Arguments of add_test(), DATA{} allowed
     )

 It passes its arguments through ``ExternalData_Expand_Arguments`` and then
 invokes the :command:`add_test` command using the results.

.. command:: ExternalData_Add_Target

  The ``ExternalData_Add_Target`` function creates a custom target to
  manage local instances of data files stored externally::

   ExternalData_Add_Target(
     <target>   # Name of data management target
     )

 It creates custom commands in the target as necessary to make data
 files available for each ``DATA{}`` reference previously evaluated by
 other functions provided by this module.
 Data files may be fetched from one of the URL templates specified in
 the ``ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES`` variable, or may be found locally
 in one of the paths specified in the ``ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES``
 variable.

 Typically only one target is needed to manage all external data within
 a project.  Call this function once at the end of configuration after
 all data references have been processed.

Module Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following variables configure behavior.  They should be set before
calling any of the functions provided by this module.

.. variable:: ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT

  The ``ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT`` variable may be set to the directory to
  hold the real data files named by expanded ``DATA{}`` references.  The
  default is ``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``.  The directory layout will mirror that of
  content links under ``ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT``.

.. variable:: ExternalData_CUSTOM_SCRIPT_<key>

  Specify a full path to a ``.cmake`` custom fetch script identified by
  ``<key>`` in entries of the ``ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES`` list.
  See Custom Fetch Scripts.

.. variable:: ExternalData_LINK_CONTENT

  The ``ExternalData_LINK_CONTENT`` variable may be set to the name of a
  supported hash algorithm to enable automatic conversion of real data
  files referenced by the ``DATA{}`` syntax into content links.  For each
  such ``<file>`` a content link named ``<file><ext>`` is created.  The
  original file is renamed to the form ``.ExternalData_<algo>_<hash>`` to
  stage it for future transmission to one of the locations in the list
  of URL templates (by means outside the scope of this module).  The
  data fetch rule created for the content link will use the staged
  object if it cannot be found using any URL template.

.. variable:: ExternalData_NO_SYMLINKS

  The real data files named by expanded ``DATA{}`` references may be made
  available under ``ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT`` using symbolic links on
  some platforms.  The ``ExternalData_NO_SYMLINKS`` variable may be set
  to disable use of symbolic links and enable use of copies instead.

.. variable:: ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES

  The ``ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES`` variable may be set to a list of local
  directories that store objects using the layout ``<dir>/%(algo)/%(hash)``.
  These directories will be searched first for a needed object.  If the
  object is not available in any store then it will be fetched remotely
  using the URL templates and added to the first local store listed.  If
  no stores are specified the default is a location inside the build
  tree.

.. variable:: ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE
              ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_PREFIX
              ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_NUMBER
              ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_SUFFIX
              ExternalData_SERIES_MATCH

  See Referencing File Series.

.. variable:: ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT

  The ``ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT`` variable may be set to the highest source
  directory containing any path named by a ``DATA{}`` reference.  The
  default is ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``.  ``ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT`` and
  ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`` must refer to directories within a single source
  distribution (e.g.  they come together in one tarball).

.. variable:: ExternalData_TIMEOUT_ABSOLUTE

  The ``ExternalData_TIMEOUT_ABSOLUTE`` variable sets the download
  absolute timeout, in seconds, with a default of ``300`` seconds.
  Set to ``0`` to disable enforcement.

.. variable:: ExternalData_TIMEOUT_INACTIVITY

  The ``ExternalData_TIMEOUT_INACTIVITY`` variable sets the download
  inactivity timeout, in seconds, with a default of ``60`` seconds.
  Set to ``0`` to disable enforcement.

.. variable:: ExternalData_URL_ALGO_<algo>_<key>

  Specify a custom URL component to be substituted for URL template
  placeholders of the form ``%(algo:<key>)``, where ``<key>`` is a
  valid C identifier, when fetching an object referenced via hash
  algorithm ``<algo>``.  If not defined, the default URL component
  is just ``<algo>`` for any ``<key>``.

.. variable:: ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES

  The ``ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES`` may be set to provide a list of
  of URL templates using the placeholders ``%(algo)`` and ``%(hash)``
  in each template.  Data fetch rules try each URL template in order
  by substituting the hash algorithm name for ``%(algo)`` and the hash
  value for ``%(hash)``.  Alternatively one may use ``%(algo:<key>)``
  with ``ExternalData_URL_ALGO_<algo>_<key>`` variables to gain more
  flexibility in remote URLs.

Referencing Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Referencing Single Files
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``DATA{}`` syntax is literal and the ``<name>`` is a full or relative path
within the source tree.  The source tree must contain either a real
data file at ``<name>`` or a "content link" at ``<name><ext>`` containing a
hash of the real file using a hash algorithm corresponding to ``<ext>``.
For example, the argument ``DATA{img.png}`` may be satisfied by either a
real ``img.png`` file in the current source directory or a ``img.png.md5``
file containing its MD5 sum.

Multiple content links of the same name with different hash algorithms
are supported (e.g. ``img.png.sha256`` and ``img.png.sha1``) so long as
they all correspond to the same real file.  This allows objects to be
fetched from sources indexed by different hash algorithms.

Referencing File Series
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``DATA{}`` syntax can be told to fetch a file series using the form
``DATA{<name>,:}``, where the ``:`` is literal.  If the source tree
contains a group of files or content links named like a series then a
reference to one member adds rules to fetch all of them.  Although all
members of a series are fetched, only the file originally named by the
``DATA{}`` argument is substituted for it.  The default configuration
recognizes file series names ending with ``#.ext``, ``_#.ext``, ``.#.ext``,
or ``-#.ext`` where ``#`` is a sequence of decimal digits and ``.ext`` is
any single extension.  Configure it with a regex that parses ``<number>``
and ``<suffix>`` parts from the end of ``<name>``::

 ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex of the form (<number>)(<suffix>)$

For more complicated cases set::

 ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex with at least two () groups
 ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_PREFIX = <prefix> regex group number, if any
 ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_NUMBER = <number> regex group number
 ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_SUFFIX = <suffix> regex group number

Configure series number matching with a regex that matches the
``<number>`` part of series members named ``<prefix><number><suffix>``::

 ExternalData_SERIES_MATCH = regex matching <number> in all series members

Note that the ``<suffix>`` of a series does not include a hash-algorithm
extension.

Referencing Associated Files
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``DATA{}`` syntax can alternatively match files associated with the
named file and contained in the same directory.  Associated files may
be specified by options using the syntax
``DATA{<name>,<opt1>,<opt2>,...}``.  Each option may specify one file by
name or specify a regular expression to match file names using the
syntax ``REGEX:<regex>``.  For example, the arguments::

 DATA{MyData/MyInput.mhd,MyInput.img}                   # File pair
 DATA{MyData/MyFrames00.png,REGEX:MyFrames[0-9]+\\.png} # Series

will pass ``MyInput.mha`` and ``MyFrames00.png`` on the command line but
ensure that the associated files are present next to them.

Referencing Directories
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``DATA{}`` syntax may reference a directory using a trailing slash and
a list of associated files.  The form ``DATA{<name>/,<opt1>,<opt2>,...}``
adds rules to fetch any files in the directory that match one of the
associated file options.  For example, the argument
``DATA{MyDataDir/,REGEX:.*}`` will pass the full path to a ``MyDataDir``
directory on the command line and ensure that the directory contains
files corresponding to every file or content link in the ``MyDataDir``
source directory.  In order to match associated files in subdirectories,
specify a ``RECURSE:`` option, e.g. ``DATA{MyDataDir/,RECURSE:,REGEX:.*}``.

Hash Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following hash algorithms are supported::

 %(algo)     <ext>     Description
 -------     -----     -----------
 MD5         .md5      Message-Digest Algorithm 5, RFC 1321
 SHA1        .sha1     US Secure Hash Algorithm 1, RFC 3174
 SHA224      .sha224   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
 SHA256      .sha256   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
 SHA384      .sha384   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
 SHA512      .sha512   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
 SHA3_224    .sha3-224 Keccak SHA-3
 SHA3_256    .sha3-256 Keccak SHA-3
 SHA3_384    .sha3-384 Keccak SHA-3
 SHA3_512    .sha3-512 Keccak SHA-3

Note that the hashes are used only for unique data identification and
download verification.

Custom Fetch Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a data file must be fetched from one of the URL templates
specified in the ``ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES`` variable, it is
normally downloaded using the ``file(DOWNLOAD)`` command.
One may specify usage of a custom fetch script by using a URL
template of the form ``ExternalDataCustomScript://<key>/<loc>``.
The ``<key>`` must be a C identifier, and the ``<loc>`` must
contain the ``%(algo)`` and ``%(hash)`` placeholders.
A variable corresponding to the key, ``ExternalData_CUSTOM_SCRIPT_<key>``,
must be set to the full path to a ``.cmake`` script file.  The script
will be included to perform the actual fetch, and provided with
the following variables:

.. variable:: ExternalData_CUSTOM_LOCATION

  When a custom fetch script is loaded, this variable is set to the
  location part of the URL, which will contain the substituted hash
  algorithm name and content hash value.

.. variable:: ExternalData_CUSTOM_FILE

  When a custom fetch script is loaded, this variable is set to the
  full path to a file in which the script must store the fetched
  content.  The name of the file is unspecified and should not be
  interpreted in any way.

The custom fetch script is expected to store fetched content in the
file or set a variable:

.. variable:: ExternalData_CUSTOM_ERROR

  When a custom fetch script fails to fetch the requested content,
  it must set this variable to a short one-line message describing
  the reason for failure.


ExternalProject
---------------

External Project Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: ExternalProject_Add

  The ``ExternalProject_Add()`` function creates a custom target to drive
  download, update/patch, configure, build, install and test steps of an
  external project:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Add(<name> [<option>...])

  The individual steps within the process can be driven independently if
  required (e.g. for CDash submission) and extra custom steps can be defined,
  along with the ability to control the step dependencies. The directory
  structure used for the management of the external project can also be
  customized. The function supports a large number of options which can be used
  to tailor the external project behavior.

  **Directory Options:**
    Most of the time, the default directory layout is sufficient. It is largely
    an implementation detail that the main project usually doesn't need to
    change. In some circumstances, however, control over the directory layout
    can be useful or necessary. The directory options are potentially more
    useful from the point of view that the main build can use the
    ``ExternalProject_Get_Property()`` command to retrieve their values,
    thereby allowing the main project to refer to build artifacts of the
    external project.

    ``PREFIX <dir>``
      Root directory for the external project. Unless otherwise noted below,
      all other directories associated with the external project will be
      created under here.

    ``TMP_DIR <dir>``
      Directory in which to store temporary files.

    ``STAMP_DIR <dir>``
      Directory in which to store the timestamps of each step. Log files from
      individual steps are also created in here unless overriden by LOG_DIR
      (see *Logging Options* below).

    ``LOG_DIR <dir>``
      Directory in which to store the logs of each step.

    ``DOWNLOAD_DIR <dir>``
      Directory in which to store downloaded files before unpacking them. This
      directory is only used by the URL download method, all other download
      methods use ``SOURCE_DIR`` directly instead.

    ``SOURCE_DIR <dir>``
      Source directory into which downloaded contents will be unpacked, or for
      non-URL download methods, the directory in which the repository should be
      checked out, cloned, etc. If no download method is specified, this must
      point to an existing directory where the external project has already
      been unpacked or cloned/checked out.

      .. note::
         If a download method is specified, any existing contents of the source
         directory may be deleted. Only the URL download method checks whether
         this directory is either missing or empty before initiating the
         download, stopping with an error if it is not empty. All other
         download methods silently discard any previous contents of the source
         directory.

    ``BINARY_DIR <dir>``
      Specify the build directory location. This option is ignored if
      ``BUILD_IN_SOURCE`` is enabled.

    ``INSTALL_DIR <dir>``
      Installation prefix to be placed in the ``<INSTALL_DIR>`` placeholder.
      This does not actually configure the external project to install to
      the given prefix. That must be done by passing appropriate arguments
      to the external project configuration step, e.g. using ``<INSTALL_DIR>``.

    If any of the above ``..._DIR`` options are not specified, their defaults
    are computed as follows. If the ``PREFIX`` option is given or the
    ``EP_PREFIX`` directory property is set, then an external project is built
    and installed under the specified prefix::

     TMP_DIR      = <prefix>/tmp
     STAMP_DIR    = <prefix>/src/<name>-stamp
     DOWNLOAD_DIR = <prefix>/src
     SOURCE_DIR   = <prefix>/src/<name>
     BINARY_DIR   = <prefix>/src/<name>-build
     INSTALL_DIR  = <prefix>
     LOG_DIR      = <STAMP_DIR>

   Otherwise, if the ``EP_BASE`` directory property is set then components
   of an external project are stored under the specified base::

     TMP_DIR      = <base>/tmp/<name>
     STAMP_DIR    = <base>/Stamp/<name>
     DOWNLOAD_DIR = <base>/Download/<name>
     SOURCE_DIR   = <base>/Source/<name>
     BINARY_DIR   = <base>/Build/<name>
     INSTALL_DIR  = <base>/Install/<name>
     LOG_DIR      = <STAMP_DIR>

   If no ``PREFIX``, ``EP_PREFIX``, or ``EP_BASE`` is specified, then the
   default is to set ``PREFIX`` to ``<name>-prefix``. Relative paths are
   interpreted with respect to :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` at the
   point where ``ExternalProject_Add()`` is called.

 **Download Step Options:**
   A download method can be omitted if the ``SOURCE_DIR`` option is used to
   point to an existing non-empty directory. Otherwise, one of the download
   methods below must be specified (multiple download methods should not be
   given) or a custom ``DOWNLOAD_COMMAND`` provided.

   ``DOWNLOAD_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Overrides the command used for the download step
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). If this option is specified, all other download options will
     be ignored. Providing an empty string for ``<cmd>`` effectively disables
     the download step.

   *URL Download*
     ``URL <url1> [<url2>...]``
       List of paths and/or URL(s) of the external project's source. When more
       than one URL is given, they are tried in turn until one succeeds. A URL
       may be an ordinary path in the local file system (in which case it
       must be the only URL provided) or any downloadable URL supported by the
       :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)` command. A local filesystem path may refer to
       either an existing directory or to an archive file, whereas a URL is
       expected to point to a file which can be treated as an archive. When an
       archive is used, it will be unpacked automatically unless the
       ``DOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT`` option is set to prevent it. The archive type
       is determined by inspecting the actual content rather than using logic
       based on the file extension.

     ``URL_HASH <algo>=<hashValue>``
       Hash of the archive file to be downloaded. The argument should be of
       the form ``<algo>=<hashValue>`` where ``algo`` can be any of the hashing
       algorithms supported by the :command:`file()` command. Specifying this
       option is strongly recommended for URL downloads, as it ensures the
       integrity of the downloaded content. It is also used as a check for a
       previously downloaded file, allowing connection to the remote location
       to be avoided altogether if the local directory already has a file from
       an earlier download that matches the specified hash.

     ``URL_MD5 <md5>``
       Equivalent to ``URL_HASH MD5=<md5>``.

     ``DOWNLOAD_NAME <fname>``
       File name to use for the downloaded file. If not given, the end of the
       URL is used to determine the file name. This option is rarely needed,
       the default name is generally suitable and is not normally used outside
       of code internal to the ``ExternalProject`` module.

     ``DOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT <bool>``
       Allows the extraction part of the download step to be disabled by
       passing a boolean true value for this option. If this option is not
       given, the downloaded contents will be unpacked automatically if
       required. If extraction has been disabled, the full path to the
       downloaded file is available as ``<DOWNLOADED_FILE>`` in subsequent
       steps or as the property ``DOWNLOADED_FILE`` with the
       :command:`ExternalProject_Get_Property` command.

     ``DOWNLOAD_NO_PROGRESS <bool>``
       Can be used to disable logging the download progress. If this option is
       not given, download progress messages will be logged.

     ``TIMEOUT <seconds>``
       Maximum time allowed for file download operations.

     ``HTTP_USERNAME <username>``
       Username for the download operation if authentication is required.

     ``HTTP_PASSWORD <password>``
       Password for the download operation if authentication is required.

     ``HTTP_HEADER <header1> [<header2>...]``
       Provides an arbitrary list of HTTP headers for the download operation.
       This can be useful for accessing content in systems like AWS, etc.

     ``TLS_VERIFY <bool>``
       Specifies whether certificate verification should be performed for
       https URLs. If this option is not provided, the default behavior is
       determined by the ``CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY`` variable (see
       :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)`). If that is also not set, certificate
       verification will not be performed. In situations where ``URL_HASH``
       cannot be provided, this option can be an alternative verification
       measure.

     ``TLS_CAINFO <file>``
       Specify a custom certificate authority file to use if ``TLS_VERIFY``
       is enabled. If this option is not specified, the value of the
       ``CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO`` variable will be used instead (see
       :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)`)

     ``NETRC <level>``
       Specify whether the .netrc file is to be used for operation. If this
       option is not specified, the value of the ``CMAKE_NETRC`` variable
       will be used instead (see :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)`)
       Valid levels are:

       ``IGNORED``
         The .netrc file is ignored.
         This is the default.
       ``OPTIONAL``
         The .netrc file is optional, and information in the URL is preferred.
         The file will be scanned to find which ever information is not specified
         in the URL.
       ``REQUIRED``
         The .netrc file is required, and information in the URL is ignored.

     ``NETRC_FILE <file>``
       Specify an alternative .netrc file to the one in your home directory
       if the ``NETRC`` level is ``OPTIONAL`` or ``REQUIRED``. If this option
       is not specified, the value of the ``CMAKE_NETRC_FILE`` variable will
       be used instead (see :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)`)

   *Git*
     NOTE: A git version of 1.6.5 or later is required if this download method
     is used.

     ``GIT_REPOSITORY <url>``
       URL of the git repository. Any URL understood by the ``git`` command
       may be used.

     ``GIT_TAG <tag>``
       Git branch name, tag or commit hash. Note that branch names and tags
       should generally be specified as remote names (i.e. ``origin/myBranch``
       rather than simply ``myBranch``). This ensures that if the remote end
       has its tag moved or branch rebased or history rewritten, the local
       clone will still be updated correctly. In general, however, specifying
       a commit hash should be preferred for a number of reasons:

       - If the local clone already has the commit corresponding to the hash,
         no ``git fetch`` needs to be performed to check for changes each time
         CMake is re-run. This can result in a significant speed up if many
         external projects are being used.
       - Using a specific git hash ensures that the main project's own history
         is fully traceable to a specific point in the external project's
         evolution. If a branch or tag name is used instead, then checking out
         a specific commit of the main project doesn't necessarily pin the
         whole build to a specific point in the life of the external project.
         The lack of such deterministic behavior makes the main project lose
         traceability and repeatability.

     ``GIT_REMOTE_NAME <name>``
       The optional name of the remote. If this option is not specified, it
       defaults to ``origin``.

     ``GIT_SUBMODULES <module>...``
       Specific git submodules that should also be updated. If this option is
       not provided, all git submodules will be updated.

     ``GIT_SHALLOW <bool>``
       When this option is enabled, the ``git clone`` operation will be given
       the ``--depth 1`` option. This performs a shallow clone, which avoids
       downloading the whole history and instead retrieves just the commit
       denoted by the ``GIT_TAG`` option.

     ``GIT_PROGRESS <bool>``
       When enabled, this option instructs the ``git clone`` operation to
       report its progress by passing it the ``--progress`` option. Without
       this option, the clone step for large projects may appear to make the
       build stall, since nothing will be logged until the clone operation
       finishes. While this option can be used to provide progress to prevent
       the appearance of the build having stalled, it may also make the build
       overly noisy if lots of external projects are used.

     ``GIT_CONFIG <option1> [<option2>...]``
       Specify a list of config options to pass to ``git clone``. Each option
       listed will be transformed into its own ``--config <option>`` on the
       ``git clone`` command line, with each option required to be in the
       form ``key=value``.

   *Subversion*
     ``SVN_REPOSITORY <url>``
       URL of the Subversion repository.

     ``SVN_REVISION -r<rev>``
       Revision to checkout from the Subversion repository.

     ``SVN_USERNAME <username>``
       Username for the Subversion checkout and update.

     ``SVN_PASSWORD <password>``
       Password for the Subversion checkout and update.

     ``SVN_TRUST_CERT <bool>``
       Specifies whether to trust the Subversion server site certificate. If
       enabled, the ``--trust-server-cert`` option is passed to the ``svn``
       checkout and update commands.

   *Mercurial*
     ``HG_REPOSITORY <url>``
       URL of the mercurial repository.

     ``HG_TAG <tag>``
       Mercurial branch name, tag or commit id.

   *CVS*
     ``CVS_REPOSITORY <cvsroot>``
       CVSROOT of the CVS repository.

     ``CVS_MODULE <mod>``
       Module to checkout from the CVS repository.

     ``CVS_TAG <tag>``
       Tag to checkout from the CVS repository.

 **Update/Patch Step Options:**
   Whenever CMake is re-run, by default the external project's sources will be
   updated if the download method supports updates (e.g. a git repository
   would be checked if the ``GIT_TAG`` does not refer to a specific commit).

   ``UPDATE_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Overrides the download method's update step with a custom command.
     The command may use
     :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

   ``UPDATE_DISCONNECTED <bool>``
     When enabled, this option causes the update step to be skipped. It does
     not, however, prevent the download step. The update step can still be
     added as a step target (see :command:`ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets`)
     and called manually. This is useful if you want to allow developers to
     build the project when disconnected from the network (the network may
     still be needed for the download step though).

     When this option is present, it is generally advisable to make the value
     a cache variable under the developer's control rather than hard-coding
     it. If this option is not present, the default value is taken from the
     ``EP_UPDATE_DISCONNECTED`` directory property. If that is also not
     defined, updates are performed as normal. The ``EP_UPDATE_DISCONNECTED``
     directory property is intended as a convenience for controlling the
     ``UPDATE_DISCONNECTED`` behavior for an entire section of a project's
     directory hierarchy and may be a more convenient method of giving
     developers control over whether or not to perform updates (assuming the
     project also provides a cache variable or some other convenient method
     for setting the directory property).

   ``PATCH_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Specifies a custom command to patch the sources after an update. By
     default, no patch command is defined. Note that it can be quite difficult
     to define an appropriate patch command that performs robustly, especially
     for download methods such as git where changing the ``GIT_TAG`` will not
     discard changes from a previous patch, but the patch command will be
     called again after updating to the new tag.

 **Configure Step Options:**
   The configure step is run after the download and update steps. By default,
   the external project is assumed to be a CMake project, but this can be
   overridden if required.

   ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     The default configure command runs CMake with options based on the main
     project. For non-CMake external projects, the ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND``
     option must be used to override this behavior
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). For projects that require no configure step, specify this
     option with an empty string as the command to execute.

   ``CMAKE_COMMAND /.../cmake``
     Specify an alternative cmake executable for the configure step (use an
     absolute path). This is generally not recommended, since it is
     usually desirable to use the same CMake version throughout the whole
     build. This option is ignored if a custom configure command has been
     specified with ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND``.

   ``CMAKE_GENERATOR <gen>``
     Override the CMake generator used for the configure step. Without this
     option, the same generator as the main build will be used. This option is
     ignored if a custom configure command has been specified with the
     ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND`` option.

   ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM <platform>``
     Pass a generator-specific platform name to the CMake command (see
     :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`). It is an error to provide this
     option without the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` option.

   ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET <toolset>``
     Pass a generator-specific toolset name to the CMake command (see
     :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`). It is an error to provide this
     option without the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` option.

   ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE <instance>``
     Pass a generator-specific instance selection to the CMake command (see
     :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE`). It is an error to provide this
     option without the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` option.

   ``CMAKE_ARGS <arg>...``
     The specified arguments are passed to the ``cmake`` command line. They
     can be any argument the ``cmake`` command understands, not just cache
     values defined by ``-D...`` arguments (see also
     :manual:`CMake Options <cmake(1)>`). In addition, arguments may use
     :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

   ``CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS <arg>...``
     This is an alternate way of specifying cache variables where command line
     length issues may become a problem. The arguments are expected to be in
     the form ``-Dvar:STRING=value``, which are then transformed into
     CMake :command:`set` commands with the ``FORCE`` option used. These
     ``set()`` commands are written to a pre-load script which is then applied
     using the :manual:`cmake -C <cmake(1)>` command line option. Arguments
     may use :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

   ``CMAKE_CACHE_DEFAULT_ARGS <arg>...``
     This is the same as the ``CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS`` option except the ``set()``
     commands do not include the ``FORCE`` keyword. This means the values act
     as initial defaults only and will not override any variables already set
     from a previous run. Use this option with care, as it can lead to
     different behavior depending on whether the build starts from a fresh
     build directory or re-uses previous build contents.

   ``SOURCE_SUBDIR <dir>``
     When no ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND`` option is specified, the configure step
     assumes the external project has a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file at the top of
     its source tree (i.e. in ``SOURCE_DIR``). The ``SOURCE_SUBDIR`` option
     can be used to point to an alternative directory within the source tree
     to use as the top of the CMake source tree instead. This must be a
     relative path and it will be interpreted as being relative to
     ``SOURCE_DIR``.  When ``BUILD_IN_SOURCE 1`` is specified, the
     ``BUILD_COMMAND`` is used to point to an alternative directory within the
     source tree.

 **Build Step Options:**
   If the configure step assumed the external project uses CMake as its build
   system, the build step will also. Otherwise, the build step will assume a
   Makefile-based build and simply run ``make`` with no arguments as the
   default build step. This can be overridden with custom build commands if
   required.

   ``BUILD_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Overrides the default build command
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). If this option is not given, the default build command will
     be chosen to integrate with the main build in the most appropriate way
     (e.g. using recursive ``make`` for Makefile generators or
     ``cmake --build`` if the project uses a CMake build). This option can be
     specified with an empty string as the command to make the build step do
     nothing.

   ``BUILD_IN_SOURCE <bool>``
     When this option is enabled, the build will be done directly within the
     external project's source tree. This should generally be avoided, the use
     of a separate build directory is usually preferred, but it can be useful
     when the external project assumes an in-source build. The ``BINARY_DIR``
     option should not be specified if building in-source.

   ``BUILD_ALWAYS <bool>``
     Enabling this option forces the build step to always be run. This can be
     the easiest way to robustly ensure that the external project's own build
     dependencies are evaluated rather than relying on the default
     success timestamp-based method. This option is not normally needed unless
     developers are expected to modify something the external project's build
     depends on in a way that is not detectable via the step target
     dependencies (e.g. ``SOURCE_DIR`` is used without a download method and
     developers might modify the sources in ``SOURCE_DIR``).

   ``BUILD_BYPRODUCTS <file>...``
     Specifies files that will be generated by the build command but which
     might or might not have their modification time updated by subsequent
     builds. These ultimately get passed through as ``BYPRODUCTS`` to the
     build step's own underlying call to :command:`add_custom_command`.

 **Install Step Options:**
   If the configure step assumed the external project uses CMake as its build
   system, the install step will also. Otherwise, the install step will assume
   a Makefile-based build and simply run ``make install`` as the default build
   step. This can be overridden with custom install commands if required.

   ``INSTALL_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     The external project's own install step is invoked as part of the main
     project's *build*. It is done after the external project's build step
     and may be before or after the external project's test step (see the
     ``TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL`` option below). The external project's install
     rules are not part of the main project's install rules, so if anything
     from the external project should be installed as part of the main build,
     these need to be specified in the main build as additional
     :command:`install` commands. The default install step builds the
     ``install`` target of the external project, but this can be overridden
     with a custom command using this option
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). Passing an empty string as the ``<cmd>`` makes the install
     step do nothing.

 **Test Step Options:**
   The test step is only defined if at least one of the following ``TEST_...``
   options are provided.

   ``TEST_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Overrides the default test command
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). If this option is not given, the default behavior of the test
     step is to build the external project's own ``test`` target. This option
     can be specified with ``<cmd>`` as an empty string, which allows the test
     step to still be defined, but it will do nothing. Do not specify any of
     the other ``TEST_...`` options if providing an empty string as the test
     command, but prefer to omit all ``TEST_...`` options altogether if the
     test step target is not needed.

   ``TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL <bool>``
     When this option is enabled, the test step will be executed before the
     install step. The default behavior is for the test step to run after the
     install step.

   ``TEST_AFTER_INSTALL <bool>``
     This option is mainly useful as a way to indicate that the test step is
     desired but all default behavior is sufficient. Specifying this option
     with a boolean true value ensures the test step is defined and that it
     comes after the install step. If both ``TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL`` and
     ``TEST_AFTER_INSTALL`` are enabled, the latter is silently ignored.

   ``TEST_EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN <bool>``
     If enabled, the main build's default ALL target will not depend on the
     test step. This can be a useful way of ensuring the test step is defined
     but only gets invoked when manually requested.

 **Output Logging Options:**
   Each of the following ``LOG_...`` options can be used to wrap the relevant
   step in a script to capture its output to files. The log files will be
   created in ``LOG_DIR`` if supplied or otherwise the ``STAMP_DIR``
   directory with step-specific file names.

   ``LOG_DOWNLOAD <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the download step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_UPDATE <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the update step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_PATCH <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the patch step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_CONFIGURE <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the configure step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_BUILD <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the build step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_INSTALL <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the install step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_TEST <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the test step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_MERGED_STDOUTERR <bool>``
     When enabled, stdout and stderr will be merged for any step whose
     output is being logged to files.

   ``LOG_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE <bool>``
     This option only has an effect if at least one of the other ``LOG_<step>``
     options is enabled.  If an error occurs for a step which has logging to
     file enabled, that step's output will be printed to the console if
     ``LOG_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE`` is set to true.  For cases where a large amount
     of output is recorded, just the end of that output may be printed to the
     console.

 **Terminal Access Options:**
   Steps can be given direct access to the terminal in some cases. Giving a
   step access to the terminal may allow it to receive terminal input if
   required, such as for authentication details not provided by other options.
   With the :generator:`Ninja` generator, these options place the steps in the
   ``console`` :prop_gbl:`job pool <JOB_POOLS>`. Each step can be given access
   to the terminal individually via the following options:

   ``USES_TERMINAL_DOWNLOAD <bool>``
     Give the download step access to the terminal.

   ``USES_TERMINAL_UPDATE <bool>``
     Give the update step access to the terminal.

   ``USES_TERMINAL_CONFIGURE <bool>``
     Give the configure step access to the terminal.

   ``USES_TERMINAL_BUILD <bool>``
     Give the build step access to the terminal.

   ``USES_TERMINAL_INSTALL <bool>``
     Give the install step access to the terminal.

   ``USES_TERMINAL_TEST <bool>``
     Give the test step access to the terminal.

 **Target Options:**
   ``DEPENDS <targets>...``
     Specify other targets on which the external project depends. The other
     targets will be brought up to date before any of the external project's
     steps are executed. Because the external project uses additional custom
     targets internally for each step, the ``DEPENDS`` option is the most
     convenient way to ensure all of those steps depend on the other targets.
     Simply doing
     :command:`add_dependencies(\<name\> \<targets\>) <add_dependencies>` will
     not make any of the steps dependent on ``<targets>``.

   ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL <bool>``
     When enabled, this option excludes the external project from the default
     ALL target of the main build.

   ``STEP_TARGETS <step-target>...``
     Generate custom targets for the specified steps. This is required if the
     steps need to be triggered manually or if they need to be used as
     dependencies of other targets. If this option is not specified, the
     default value is taken from the ``EP_STEP_TARGETS`` directory property.
     See :command:`ExternalProject_Add_Step` below for further discussion of
     the effects of this option.

   ``INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS <step-target>...``
     Generate custom targets for the specified steps and prevent these targets
     from having the usual dependencies applied to them. If this option is not
     specified, the default value is taken from the
     ``EP_INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS`` directory property. This option is mostly
     useful for allowing individual steps to be driven independently, such as
     for a CDash setup where each step should be initiated and reported
     individually rather than as one whole build. See
     :command:`ExternalProject_Add_Step` below for further discussion of the
     effects of this option.

 **Miscellaneous Options:**
   ``LIST_SEPARATOR <sep>``
     For any of the various ``..._COMMAND`` options, replace ``;`` with
     ``<sep>`` in the specified command lines. This can be useful where list
     variables may be given in commands where they should end up as
     space-separated arguments (``<sep>`` would be a single space character
     string in this case).

   ``COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Any of the other ``..._COMMAND`` options can have additional commands
     appended to them by following them with as many ``COMMAND ...`` options
     as needed
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). For example:

     .. code-block:: cmake

       ExternalProject_Add(example
         ... # Download options, etc.
         BUILD_COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "Starting $<CONFIG> build"
         COMMAND       ${CMAKE_COMMAND} --build <BINARY_DIR> --config $<CONFIG>
         COMMAND       ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "$<CONFIG> build complete"
       )

 It should also be noted that each build step is created via a call to
 :command:`ExternalProject_Add_Step`. See that command's documentation for the
 automatic substitutions that are supported for some options.

Obtaining Project Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: ExternalProject_Get_Property

  The ``ExternalProject_Get_Property()`` function retrieves external project
  target properties:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Get_Property(<name> <prop1> [<prop2>...])

  The function stores property values in variables of the same name. Property
  names correspond to the keyword argument names of ``ExternalProject_Add()``.
  For example, the source directory might be retrieved like so:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Get_property(myExtProj SOURCE_DIR)
    message("Source dir of myExtProj = ${SOURCE_DIR}")

Explicit Step Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``ExternalProject_Add()`` function on its own is often sufficient for
incorporating an external project into the main build. Certain scenarios
require additional work to implement desired behavior, such as adding in a
custom step or making steps available as manually triggerable targets. The
``ExternalProject_Add_Step()``, ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` and
``ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies`` functions provide the lower level
control needed to implement such step-level capabilities.

.. command:: ExternalProject_Add_Step

  The ``ExternalProject_Add_Step()`` function specifies an additional custom
  step for an external project defined by an earlier call to
  ``ExternalProject_Add()``:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Add_Step(<name> <step> [<option>...])

  ``<name>`` is the same as the name passed to the original call to
  ``ExternalProject_Add()``. The specified ``<step>`` must not be one of
  the pre-defined steps (``mkdir``, ``download``, ``update``, ``skip-update``,
  ``patch``, ``configure``, ``build``, ``install`` or ``test``). The supported
  options are:

  ``COMMAND <cmd>...``
    The command line to be executed by this custom step
    (``generator expressions`` are
    supported). This option can be repeated multiple times to specify multiple
    commands to be executed in order.

  ``COMMENT "<text>..."``
    Text to be printed when the custom step executes.

  ``DEPENDEES <step>...``
    Other steps (custom or pre-defined) on which this step depends.

  ``DEPENDERS <step>...``
    Other steps (custom or pre-defined) that depend on this new custom step.

  ``DEPENDS <file>...``
    Files on which this custom step depends.

  ``BYPRODUCTS <file>...``
    Files that will be generated by this custom step but which might or might
    not have their modification time updated by subsequent builds. This list of
    files will ultimately be passed through as the ``BYPRODUCTS`` option to the
    ``add_custom_command()`` used to implement the custom step internally.

  ``ALWAYS <bool>``
    When enabled, this option specifies that the custom step should always be
    run (i.e. that it is always considered out of date).

  ``EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN <bool>``
    When enabled, this option specifies that the external project's main target
    does not depend on the custom step.

  ``WORKING_DIRECTORY <dir>``
    Specifies the working directory to set before running the custom step's
    command. If this option is not specified, the directory will be the value
    of the ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` at the point where
    ``ExternalProject_Add_Step()`` was called.

  ``LOG <bool>``
    If set, this causes the output from the custom step to be captured to files
    in the external project's ``LOG_DIR`` if supplied or ``STAMP_DIR``.

  ``USES_TERMINAL <bool>``
    If enabled, this gives the custom step direct access to the terminal if
    possible.

  The command line, comment, working directory and byproducts of every
  standard and custom step are processed to replace the tokens
  ``<SOURCE_DIR>``, ``<SOURCE_SUBDIR>``, ``<BINARY_DIR>``, ``<INSTALL_DIR>``
  ``<TMP_DIR>``, ``<DOWNLOAD_DIR>`` and ``<DOWNLOADED_FILE>`` with their
  corresponding property values defined in the original call to
  ``ExternalProject_Add()``.

.. command:: ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets

  The ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` function generates targets for the
  steps listed. The name of each created target will be of the form
  ``<name>-<step>``:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(<name> [NO_DEPENDS] <step1> [<step2>...])

  Creating a target for a step allows it to be used as a dependency of another
  target or to be triggered manually. Having targets for specific steps also
  allows them to be driven independently of each other by specifying targets on
  build command lines. For example, you may be submitting to a sub-project
  based dashboard where you want to drive the configure portion of the build,
  then submit to the dashboard, followed by the build portion, followed
  by tests. If you invoke a custom target that depends on a step halfway
  through the step dependency chain, then all the previous steps will also run
  to ensure everything is up to date.

  If the ``NO_DEPENDS`` option is specified, the step target will not depend on
  the dependencies of the external project (i.e. on any dependencies of the
  ``<name>`` custom target created by ``ExternalProject_Add()``). This is
  usually safe for the ``download``, ``update`` and ``patch`` steps, since they
  do not typically require that the dependencies are updated and built. Using
  ``NO_DEPENDS`` for any of the other pre-defined steps, however, may break
  parallel builds. Only use ``NO_DEPENDS`` where it is certain that the named
  steps genuinely do not have dependencies. For custom steps, consider whether
  or not the custom commands require the dependencies to be configured, built
  and installed.

  Internally, ``ExternalProject_Add()`` calls
  ``ExternalProject_Add_Step()`` to create each step. If any
  ``STEP_TARGETS`` or ``INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS`` were specified, then
  ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` will also be called after
  ``ExternalProject_Add_Step()``. ``INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS`` have the
  ``NO_DEPENDS`` option set, whereas ``STEP_TARGETS`` do not. Other than that,
  the two options result in ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` being called
  in the same way. Even if a step is not mentioned in either of those two
  options, ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` can still be called later to
  manually define a target for the step.

  The ``STEP_TARGETS`` and ``INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS`` options for
  ``ExternalProject_Add()`` are generally the easiest way to ensure
  targets are created for specific steps of interest. For custom steps,
  ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` must be called explicitly if a target
  should also be created for that custom step. An alternative to these two
  options is to populate the ``EP_STEP_TARGETS`` and
  ``EP_INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS`` directory properties. These act as defaults
  for the step target options and can save having to repeatedly specify the
  same set of step targets when multiple external projects are being defined.

.. command:: ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies

  The ``ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies()`` function can be used to add
  dependencies to a step. The dependencies added must be targets CMake already
  knows about (these can be ordinary executable or library targets, custom
  targets or even step targets of another external project):

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies(<name> <step> <target1> [<target2>...])

  This function takes care to set both target and file level dependencies and
  will ensure that parallel builds will not break. It should be used instead of
  ``add_dependencies()`` whenever adding a dependency for some of the step
  targets generated by the ``ExternalProject`` module.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

The following example shows how to download and build a hypothetical project
called *FooBar* from github:

 include(ExternalProject)
 ExternalProject_Add(foobar
   GIT_REPOSITORY    git@github.com:FooCo/FooBar.git
   GIT_TAG           origin/release/1.2.3
 )

For the sake of the example, also define a second hypothetical external project
called *SecretSauce*, which is downloaded from a web server. Two URLs are given
to take advantage of a faster internal network if available, with a fallback to
a slower external server. The project is a typical ``Makefile`` project with no
configure step, so some of the default commands are overridden. The build is
only required to build the *sauce* target:

 find_program(MAKE_EXE NAMES gmake nmake make)
 ExternalProject_Add(secretsauce
   URL               http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz
                     https://www.somecompany.com/downloads/sauce-2.7.zip
   URL_HASH          MD5=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
   CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
   BUILD_COMMAND     ${MAKE_EXE} sauce
 )

Suppose the build step of ``secretsauce`` requires that ``foobar`` must already
be built. This could be enforced like so:

 ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies(secretsauce build foobar)

Another alternative would be to create a custom target for ``foobar``'s build
step and make ``secretsauce`` depend on that rather than the whole ``foobar``
project. This would mean ``foobar`` only needs to be built, it doesn't need to
run its install or test steps before ``secretsauce`` can be built. The
dependency can also be defined along with the ``secretsauce`` project:

 ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(foobar build)
 ExternalProject_Add(secretsauce
   URL               http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz
                     https://www.somecompany.com/downloads/sauce-2.7.zip
   URL_HASH          MD5=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
   CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
   BUILD_COMMAND     ${MAKE_EXE} sauce
   DEPENDS           foobar-build
 )

Instead of calling ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()``, the target could
be defined along with the ``foobar`` project itself:

 ExternalProject_Add(foobar
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@github.com:FooCo/FooBar.git
   GIT_TAG        origin/release/1.2.3
   STEP_TARGETS   build
 )

If many external projects should have the same set of step targets, setting a
directory property may be more convenient. The ``build`` step target could be
created automatically by setting the ``EP_STEP_TARGETS`` directory property
before creating the external projects with ``ExternalProject_Add()``:

 set_property(DIRECTORY PROPERTY EP_STEP_TARGETS build)

Lastly, suppose that ``secretsauce`` provides a script called ``makedoc`` which
can be used to generate its own documentation. Further suppose that the script
expects the output directory to be provided as the only parameter and that it
should be run from the ``secretsauce`` source directory. A custom step and a
custom target to trigger the script can be defined like so:

 ExternalProject_Add_Step(secretsauce docs
   COMMAND           <SOURCE_DIR>/makedoc <BINARY_DIR>
   WORKING_DIRECTORY <SOURCE_DIR>
   COMMENT           "Building secretsauce docs"
   ALWAYS            TRUE
   EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN TRUE
 )
 ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(secretsauce docs)

The custom step could then be triggered from the main build like so::

 cmake --build . --target secretsauce-docs

FeatureSummary
--------------

Functions for generating a summary of enabled/disabled features.

These functions can be used to generate a summary of enabled and disabled
packages and/or feature for a build tree such as::

 -- The following OPTIONAL packages have been found:
 LibXml2 (required version >= 2.4), XML processing lib, <http://xmlsoft.org>
    * Enables HTML-import in MyWordProcessor
    * Enables odt-export in MyWordProcessor
 PNG, A PNG image library., <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/>
    * Enables saving screenshots
 -- The following OPTIONAL packages have not been found:
 Lua51, The Lua scripting language., <http://www.lua.org>
    * Enables macros in MyWordProcessor
 Foo, Foo provides cool stuff.

Global Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES

The global property ``FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES`` defines the type of
packages used by `FeatureSummary`.

The order in this list is important, the first package type in the list is the
least important, the last is the most important. the of a package can only be
changed to higher types.

The default package types are , ``RUNTIME``, ``OPTIONAL``, ``RECOMMENDED`` and
``REQUIRED``, and their importance is
``RUNTIME < OPTIONAL < RECOMMENDED < REQUIRED``.


.. variable:: FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES

The global property ``FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES`` defines which
package types are required.

If one or more package in this categories has not been found, CMake will abort
when calling ``feature_summary()`` with the
'FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES' option enabled.

The default value for this global property is ``REQUIRED``.


.. variable:: FeatureSummary_DEFAULT_PKG_TYPE

The global property ``FeatureSummary_DEFAULT_PKG_TYPE`` defines which
package type is the default one.
When calling ``feature_summary()``, if the user did not set the package type
explicitly, the package will be assigned to this category.

This value must be one of the types defined in the
``FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES`` global property unless the package type
is set for all the packages.

The default value for this global property is ``OPTIONAL``.


.. variable:: FeatureSummary_<TYPE>_DESCRIPTION

The global property ``FeatureSummary_<TYPE>_DESCRIPTION`` can be defined
for each type to replace the type name with the specified string whenever the
package type is used in an output string.

If not set, the string "``<TYPE>`` packages" is used.




Functions
^^^^^^^^^


.. command:: feature_summary

  ::

   feature_summary( [FILENAME <file>]
                    [APPEND]
                    [VAR <variable_name>]
                    [INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES]
                    [FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES]
                    [DESCRIPTION "<description>" | DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION]
                    [QUIET_ON_EMPTY]
                    WHAT (ALL
                         | PACKAGES_FOUND | PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
                         | <TYPE>_PACKAGES_FOUND | <TYPE>_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
                         | ENABLED_FEATURES | DISABLED_FEATURES)
                  )

 The ``feature_summary()`` macro can be used to print information about
 enabled or disabled packages or features of a project.  By default,
 only the names of the features/packages will be printed and their
 required version when one was specified.  Use ``set_package_properties()``
 to add more useful information, like e.g.  a download URL for the
 respective package or their purpose in the project.

 The ``WHAT`` option is the only mandatory option.  Here you specify what
 information will be printed:

 ``ALL``
  print everything
 ``ENABLED_FEATURES``
  the list of all features which are enabled
 ``DISABLED_FEATURES``
  the list of all features which are disabled
 ``PACKAGES_FOUND``
  the list of all packages which have been found
 ``PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND``
  the list of all packages which have not been found

 For each package type ``<TYPE>`` defined by the
 :variable:`FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES` global property, the following
 information can also be used:

 ``<TYPE>_PACKAGES_FOUND``
  only those packages which have been found which have the type <TYPE>
 ``<TYPE>_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND``
  only those packages which have not been found which have the type <TYPE>

 With the exception of the ``ALL`` value, these values can be combined
 in order to customize the output. For example:

 .. code-block:: cmake

   feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES DISABLED_FEATURES)

 If a ``FILENAME`` is given, the information is printed into this file.  If
 ``APPEND`` is used, it is appended to this file, otherwise the file is
 overwritten if it already existed.  If the VAR option is used, the
 information is "printed" into the specified variable.  If ``FILENAME`` is
 not used, the information is printed to the terminal.  Using the
 ``DESCRIPTION`` option a description or headline can be set which will be
 printed above the actual content.  If only one type of
 package was requested, no title is printed, unless it is explicitly set using
 either ``DESCRIPTION`` to use a custom string, or ``DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION`` to
 use a default title for the requested type.
 If ``INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES`` is given, packages which have been searched with
 ``find_package(... QUIET)`` will also be listed. By default they are skipped.
 If ``FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES`` is given, CMake will abort if a
 package which is marked as one of the package types listed in the
 :variable:`FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES` global property has not been
 found.
 The default value for the :variable:`FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES` global
 property is ``REQUIRED``.

 The :variable:`FeatureSummary_DEFAULT_PKG_TYPE` global property can be
 modified to change the default package type assigned when not explicitly
 assigned by the user.

 If the ``QUIET_ON_EMPTY`` option is used, if only one type of package was
 requested, and no packages belonging to that category were found, then no
 output (including the ``DESCRIPTION``) is printed or added to the ``VAR``
 variable.

 Example 1, append everything to a file:

 .. code-block:: cmake

  include(FeatureSummary)
  feature_summary(WHAT ALL
                  FILENAME ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/all.log APPEND)

 Example 2, print the enabled features into the variable
 enabledFeaturesText, including QUIET packages:

 .. code-block:: cmake

  include(FeatureSummary)
  feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES
                  INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES
                  DESCRIPTION "Enabled Features:"
                  VAR enabledFeaturesText)
  message(STATUS "${enabledFeaturesText}")

 Example 3, change default package types and print only the categories that
 are not empty:

 .. code-block:: cmake

  include(FeatureSummary)
  set_property(GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES BUILD)
  find_package(FOO)
  set_package_properties(FOO PROPERTIES TYPE BUILD)
  feature_summary(WHAT BUILD_PACKAGES_FOUND
                  Description "Build tools found:"
                  QUIET_ON_EMPTY)
  feature_summary(WHAT BUILD_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
                  Description "Build tools not found:"
                  QUIET_ON_EMPTY)

.. command:: set_package_properties

  ::

   set_package_properties(<name> PROPERTIES
                          [ URL <url> ]
                          [ DESCRIPTION <description> ]
                          [ TYPE (RUNTIME|OPTIONAL|RECOMMENDED|REQUIRED) ]
                          [ PURPOSE <purpose> ]
                         )

 Use this macro to set up information about the named package, which
 can then be displayed via FEATURE_SUMMARY().  This can be done either
 directly in the Find-module or in the project which uses the module
 after the find_package() call.  The features for which information can
 be set are added automatically by the find_package() command.

 ``URL <url>``
   This should be the homepage of the package, or something similar.
   Ideally this is set already directly in the Find-module.

 ``DESCRIPTION <description>``
   A short description what that package is, at most one sentence.
   Ideally this is set already directly in the Find-module.

 ``TYPE <type>``
   What type of dependency has the using project on that package.
   Default is ``OPTIONAL``.  In this case it is a package which can be used
   by the project when available at buildtime, but it also work without.
   ``RECOMMENDED`` is similar to ``OPTIONAL``, i.e.  the project will build if
   the package is not present, but the functionality of the resulting
   binaries will be severely limited.  If a ``REQUIRED`` package is not
   available at buildtime, the project may not even build.  This can be
   combined with the ``FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES`` argument for
   ``feature_summary()``.  Last, a ``RUNTIME`` package is a package which is
   actually not used at all during the build, but which is required for
   actually running the resulting binaries.  So if such a package is
   missing, the project can still be built, but it may not work later on.
   If ``set_package_properties()`` is called multiple times for the same
   package with different TYPEs, the ``TYPE`` is only changed to higher
   TYPEs (``RUNTIME < OPTIONAL < RECOMMENDED < REQUIRED``), lower TYPEs are
   ignored.  The ``TYPE`` property is project-specific, so it cannot be set
   by the Find-module, but must be set in the project.
   Type accepted can be changed by setting the
   :variable:`FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES` global property.

 ``PURPOSE <purpose>``
   This describes which features this package enables in the
   project, i.e.  it tells the user what functionality he gets in the
   resulting binaries.  If set_package_properties() is called multiple
   times for a package, all PURPOSE properties are appended to a list of
   purposes of the package in the project.  As the TYPE property, also
   the PURPOSE property is project-specific, so it cannot be set by the
   Find-module, but must be set in the project.

 Example for setting the info for a package:

 .. code-block:: cmake

   find_package(LibXml2)
   set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES
                          DESCRIPTION "A XML processing library."
                          URL "http://xmlsoft.org/")
   # or
   set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES
                          TYPE RECOMMENDED
                          PURPOSE "Enables HTML-import in MyWordProcessor")
   # or
   set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES
                          TYPE OPTIONAL
                          PURPOSE "Enables odt-export in MyWordProcessor")

   find_package(DBUS)
   set_package_properties(DBUS PROPERTIES
     TYPE RUNTIME
     PURPOSE "Necessary to disable the screensaver during a presentation")

.. command:: add_feature_info

  ::

   add_feature_info(<name> <enabled> <description>)

 Use this macro to add information about a feature with the given ``<name>``.
 ``<enabled>`` contains whether this feature is enabled or not. It can be a
 variable or a list of conditions.
 ``<description>`` is a text describing the feature.  The information can
 be displayed using ``feature_summary()`` for ``ENABLED_FEATURES`` and
 ``DISABLED_FEATURES`` respectively.

 Example for setting the info for a feature:

 .. code-block:: cmake

    option(WITH_FOO "Help for foo" ON)
    add_feature_info(Foo WITH_FOO "The Foo feature provides very cool stuff.")

Legacy Macros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following macros are provided for compatibility with previous
CMake versions:

.. command:: set_package_info

  ::

   set_package_info(<name> <description> [ <url> [<purpose>] ])

 Use this macro to set up information about the named package, which
 can then be displayed via ``feature_summary()``.  This can be done either
 directly in the Find-module or in the project which uses the module
 after the :command:`find_package` call.  The features for which information
 can be set are added automatically by the ``find_package()`` command.

.. command:: set_feature_info

  ::

   set_feature_info(<name> <description> [<url>])

 Does the same as::

   set_package_info(<name> <description> <url>)

.. command:: print_enabled_features

  ::

   print_enabled_features()

 Does the same as

 .. code-block:: cmake

   feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES DESCRIPTION "Enabled features:")

.. command:: print_disabled_features

  ::

   print_disabled_features()

 Does the same as

 .. code-block:: cmake

   feature_summary(WHAT DISABLED_FEATURES DESCRIPTION "Disabled features:")

FetchContent
------------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

This module enables populating content at configure time via any method
supported by the ``ExternalProject`` module.  Whereas
``ExternalProject_Add()`` downloads at build time, the
``FetchContent`` module makes content available immediately, allowing the
configure step to use the content in commands like ``add_subdirectory()``,
``include()`` or ``file()`` operations.

Content population details would normally be defined separately from the
command that performs the actual population.  This separation ensures that
all of the dependency details are defined before anything may try to use those
details to populate content.  This is particularly important in more complex
project hierarchies where dependencies may be shared between multiple projects.

The following shows a typical example of declaring content details:

 FetchContent_Declare(
   googletest
   GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
   GIT_TAG        release-1.8.0
 )

For most typical cases, populating the content can then be done with a single
command like so:

 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

The above command not only populates the content, it also adds it to the main
build (if possible) so that the main build can use the populated project's
targets, etc.  In some cases, the main project may need to have more precise
control over the population or may be required to explicitly define the
population steps (e.g. if CMake versions earlier than 3.14 need to be
supported).  The typical pattern of such custom steps looks like this:

 FetchContent_GetProperties(googletest)
 if(NOT googletest_POPULATED)
   FetchContent_Populate(googletest)
   add_subdirectory(${googletest_SOURCE_DIR} ${googletest_BINARY_DIR})
 endif()

Regardless of which population method is used, when using the
declare-populate pattern with a hierarchical project arrangement, projects at
higher levels in the hierarchy are able to override the population details of
content specified anywhere lower in the project hierarchy.  The ability to
detect whether content has already been populated ensures that even if
multiple child projects want certain content to be available, the first one
to populate it wins.  The other child project can simply make use of the
already available content instead of repeating the population for itself.
See the :ref:`Examples <fetch-content-examples>` section which demonstrates
this scenario.

The ``FetchContent`` module also supports defining and populating
content in a single call, with no check for whether the content has been
populated elsewhere in the project already.  This is a more low level
operation and would not normally be the way the module is used, but it is
sometimes useful as part of implementing some higher level feature or to
populate some content in CMake's script mode.


Declaring Content Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: FetchContent_Declare

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_Declare(<name> <contentOptions>...)

  The ``FetchContent_Declare()`` function records the options that describe
  how to populate the specified content, but if such details have already
  been recorded earlier in this project (regardless of where in the project
  hierarchy), this and all later calls for the same content ``<name>`` are
  ignored.  This "first to record, wins" approach is what allows hierarchical
  projects to have parent projects override content details of child projects.

  The content ``<name>`` can be any string without spaces, but good practice
  would be to use only letters, numbers and underscores.  The name will be
  treated case-insensitively and it should be obvious for the content it
  represents, often being the name of the child project or the value given
  to its top level ``project()`` command (if it is a CMake project).
  For well-known public projects, the name should generally be the official
  name of the project.  Choosing an unusual name makes it unlikely that other
  projects needing that same content will use the same name, leading to
  the content being populated multiple times.

  The ``<contentOptions>`` can be any of the download or update/patch options
  that the ``ExternalProject_Add()`` command understands.  The configure,
  build, install and test steps are explicitly disabled and therefore options
  related to them will be ignored.  In most cases, ``<contentOptions>`` will
  just be a couple of options defining the download method and method-specific
  details like a commit tag or archive hash.  For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_Declare(
      googletest
      GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
      GIT_TAG        release-1.8.0
    )

    FetchContent_Declare(
      myCompanyIcons
      URL      https://intranet.mycompany.com/assets/iconset_1.12.tar.gz
      URL_HASH 5588a7b18261c20068beabfb4f530b87
    )

    FetchContent_Declare(
      myCompanyCertificates
      SVN_REPOSITORY svn+ssh://svn.mycompany.com/srv/svn/trunk/certs
      SVN_REVISION   -r12345
    )

Populating The Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For most common scenarios, population means making content available to the
main build according to previously declared details for that dependency.
There are two main patterns for populating content, one based on calling
``FetchContent_GetProperties()`` and
``FetchContent_Populate()`` for more precise control and the other on
calling ``FetchContent_MakeAvailable()`` for a simpler, more automated
approach.  The former generally follows this canonical pattern:

 # Check if population has already been performed
 FetchContent_GetProperties(<name>)
 string(TOLOWER "<name>" lcName)
 if(NOT ${lcName}_POPULATED)
   # Fetch the content using previously declared details
   FetchContent_Populate(<name>)

   # Set custom variables, policies, etc.
   # ...

   # Bring the populated content into the build
   add_subdirectory(${${lcName}_SOURCE_DIR} ${${lcName}_BINARY_DIR})
 endif()

The above is such a common pattern that, where no custom steps are needed
between the calls to ``FetchContent_Populate()`` and
``add_subdirectory()``, equivalent logic can be obtained by calling
``FetchContent_MakeAvailable()`` instead (and should be preferred where
it meets the needs of the project).

.. command:: FetchContent_Populate

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_Populate( <name> )

  In most cases, the only argument given to ``FetchContent_Populate()`` is the
  ``<name>``.  When used this way, the command assumes the content details have
  been recorded by an earlier call to ``FetchContent_Declare()``.  The
  details are stored in a global property, so they are unaffected by things
  like variable or directory scope.  Therefore, it doesn't matter where in the
  project the details were previously declared, as long as they have been
  declared before the call to ``FetchContent_Populate()``.  Those saved details
  are then used to construct a call to ``ExternalProject_Add()`` in a
  private sub-build to perform the content population immediately.  The
  implementation of ``ExternalProject_Add()`` ensures that if the content has
  already been populated in a previous CMake run, that content will be reused
  rather than repopulating them again.  For the common case where population
  involves downloading content, the cost of the download is only paid once.

  An internal global property records when a particular content population
  request has been processed.  If ``FetchContent_Populate()`` is called more
  than once for the same content name within a configure run, the second call
  will halt with an error.  Projects can and should check whether content
  population has already been processed with the
  ``FetchContent_GetProperties()`` command before calling
  ``FetchContent_Populate()``.

  ``FetchContent_Populate()`` will set three variables in the scope of the
  caller; ``<lcName>_POPULATED``, ``<lcName>_SOURCE_DIR`` and
  ``<lcName>_BINARY_DIR``, where ``<lcName>`` is the lowercased ``<name>``.
  ``<lcName>_POPULATED`` will always be set to ``True`` by the call.
  ``<lcName>_SOURCE_DIR`` is the location where the
  content can be found upon return (it will have already been populated), while
  ``<lcName>_BINARY_DIR`` is a directory intended for use as a corresponding
  build directory.  The main use case for the two directory variables is to
  call ``add_subdirectory()`` immediately after population, i.e.:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_Populate(FooBar ...)
    add_subdirectory(${foobar_SOURCE_DIR} ${foobar_BINARY_DIR})

  The values of the three variables can also be retrieved from anywhere in the
  project hierarchy using the ``FetchContent_GetProperties()`` command.

  A number of cache variables influence the behavior of all content population
  performed using details saved from a ``FetchContent_Declare()`` call:

  ``FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR``
    In most cases, the saved details do not specify any options relating to the
    directories to use for the internal sub-build, final source and build areas.
    It is generally best to leave these decisions up to the ``FetchContent``
    module to handle on the project's behalf.  The ``FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR``
    cache variable controls the point under which all content population
    directories are collected, but in most cases developers would not need to
    change this.  The default location is ``${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/_deps``, but if
    developers change this value, they should aim to keep the path short and
    just below the top level of the build tree to avoid running into path
    length problems on Windows.

  ``FETCHCONTENT_QUIET``
    The logging output during population can be quite verbose, making the
    configure stage quite noisy.  This cache option (``ON`` by default) hides
    all population output unless an error is encountered.  If experiencing
    problems with hung downloads, temporarily switching this option off may
    help diagnose which content population is causing the issue.

  ``FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED``
    When this option is enabled, no attempt is made to download or update
    any content.  It is assumed that all content has already been populated in
    a previous run or the source directories have been pointed at existing
    contents the developer has provided manually (using options described
    further below).  When the developer knows that no changes have been made to
    any content details, turning this option ``ON`` can significantly speed up
    the configure stage.  It is ``OFF`` by default.

  ``FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED``
    This is a less severe download/update control compared to
    ``FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED``.  Instead of bypassing all download and
    update logic, the ``FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED`` only disables the
    update stage.  Therefore, if content has not been downloaded previously,
    it will still be downloaded when this option is enabled.  This can speed up
    the configure stage, but not as much as
    ``FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED``.  It is ``OFF`` by default.

  In addition to the above cache variables, the following cache variables are
  also defined for each content name (``<ucName>`` is the uppercased value of
  ``<name>``):

  ``FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_<ucName>``
    If this is set, no download or update steps are performed for the specified
    content and the ``<lcName>_SOURCE_DIR`` variable returned to the caller is
    pointed at this location.  This gives developers a way to have a separate
    checkout of the content that they can modify freely without interference
    from the build.  The build simply uses that existing source, but it still
    defines ``<lcName>_BINARY_DIR`` to point inside its own build area.
    Developers are strongly encouraged to use this mechanism rather than
    editing the sources populated in the default location, as changes to
    sources in the default location can be lost when content population details
    are changed by the project.

  ``FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED_<ucName>``
    This is the per-content equivalent of
    ``FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED``. If the global option or this option
    is ``ON``, then updates will be disabled for the named content.
    Disabling updates for individual content can be useful for content whose
    details rarely change, while still leaving other frequently changing
    content with updates enabled.


  The ``FetchContent_Populate()`` command also supports a syntax allowing the
  content details to be specified directly rather than using any saved
  details.  This is more low-level and use of this form is generally to be
  avoided in favour of using saved content details as outlined above.
  Nevertheless, in certain situations it can be useful to invoke the content
  population as an isolated operation (typically as part of implementing some
  other higher level feature or when using CMake in script mode):

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_Populate( <name>
      [QUIET]
      [SUBBUILD_DIR <subBuildDir>]
      [SOURCE_DIR <srcDir>]
      [BINARY_DIR <binDir>]
      ...
    )

  This form has a number of key differences to that where only ``<name>`` is
  provided:

  - All required population details are assumed to have been provided directly
    in the call to ``FetchContent_Populate()``. Any saved details for
    ``<name>`` are ignored.
  - No check is made for whether content for ``<name>`` has already been
    populated.
  - No global property is set to record that the population has occurred.
  - No global properties record the source or binary directories used for the
    populated content.
  - The ``FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED`` and
    ``FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED`` cache variables are ignored.

  The ``<lcName>_SOURCE_DIR`` and ``<lcName>_BINARY_DIR`` variables are still
  returned to the caller, but since these locations are not stored as global
  properties when this form is used, they are only available to the calling
  scope and below rather than the entire project hierarchy.  No
  ``<lcName>_POPULATED`` variable is set in the caller's scope with this form.

  The supported options for ``FetchContent_Populate()`` are the same as those
  for ``FetchContent_Declare()``.  Those few options shown just
  above are either specific to ``FetchContent_Populate()`` or their behavior is
  slightly modified from how ``ExternalProject_Add()`` treats them.

  ``QUIET``
    The ``QUIET`` option can be given to hide the output associated with
    populating the specified content.  If the population fails, the output will
    be shown regardless of whether this option was given or not so that the
    cause of the failure can be diagnosed.  The global ``FETCHCONTENT_QUIET``
    cache variable has no effect on ``FetchContent_Populate()`` calls where the
    content details are provided directly.

  ``SUBBUILD_DIR``
    The ``SUBBUILD_DIR`` argument can be provided to change the location of the
    sub-build created to perform the population.  The default value is
    ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<lcName>-subbuild`` and it would be unusual
    to need to override this default.  If a relative path is specified, it will
    be interpreted as relative to ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR``.

  ``SOURCE_DIR``, ``BINARY_DIR``
    The ``SOURCE_DIR`` and ``BINARY_DIR`` arguments are supported by
    ``ExternalProject_Add()``, but different default values are used by
    ``FetchContent_Populate()``.  ``SOURCE_DIR`` defaults to
    ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<lcName>-src`` and ``BINARY_DIR`` defaults to
    ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<lcName>-build``.  If a relative path is
    specified, it will be interpreted as relative to
    ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR``.

  In addition to the above explicit options, any other unrecognized options are
  passed through unmodified to ``ExternalProject_Add()`` to perform the
  download, patch and update steps.  The following options are explicitly
  prohibited (they are disabled by the ``FetchContent_Populate()`` command):

  - ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND``
  - ``BUILD_COMMAND``
  - ``INSTALL_COMMAND``
  - ``TEST_COMMAND``

  If using ``FetchContent_Populate()`` within CMake's script mode, be aware
  that the implementation sets up a sub-build which therefore requires a CMake
  generator and build tool to be available. If these cannot be found by
  default, then the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` and/or
  ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` variables will need to be set appropriately
  on the command line invoking the script.


.. command:: FetchContent_GetProperties

  When using saved content details, a call to ``FetchContent_Populate()``
  records information in global properties which can be queried at any time.
  This information includes the source and binary directories associated with
  the content and also whether or not the content population has been processed
  during the current configure run.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_GetProperties( <name>
      [SOURCE_DIR <srcDirVar>]
      [BINARY_DIR <binDirVar>]
      [POPULATED <doneVar>]
    )

  The ``SOURCE_DIR``, ``BINARY_DIR`` and ``POPULATED`` options can be used to
  specify which properties should be retrieved.  Each option accepts a value
  which is the name of the variable in which to store that property.  Most of
  the time though, only ``<name>`` is given, in which case the call will then
  set the same variables as a call to
  ``FetchContent_Populate(name)``.  This allows
  the following canonical pattern to be used, which ensures that the relevant
  variables will always be defined regardless of whether or not the population
  has been performed elsewhere in the project already:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_GetProperties(foobar)
    if(NOT foobar_POPULATED)
      FetchContent_Populate(foobar)
      ...
    endif()

  The above pattern allows other parts of the overall project hierarchy to
  re-use the same content and ensure that it is only populated once.


.. command:: FetchContent_MakeAvailable

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_MakeAvailable( <name1> [<name2>...] )

  This command implements the common pattern typically needed for most
  dependencies.  It iterates over each of the named dependencies in turn
  and for each one it loosely follows the same
  :ref:`canonical pattern <fetch-content-canonical-pattern>` as
  presented at the beginning of this section.  One small difference to
  that pattern is that it will only call ``add_subdirectory()`` on the
  populated content if there is a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in its top level
  source directory.  This allows the command to be used for dependencies
  that make downloaded content available at a known location but which do
  not need or support being added directly to the build.


Examples
^^^^^^^^

This first fairly straightforward example ensures that some popular testing
frameworks are available to the main build:

 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Declare(
   googletest
   GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
   GIT_TAG        release-1.8.0
 )
 FetchContent_Declare(
   Catch2
   GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
   GIT_TAG        v2.5.0
 )

 # After the following call, the CMake targets defined by googletest and
 # Catch2 will be defined and available to the rest of the build
 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest Catch2)

In more complex project hierarchies, the dependency relationships can be more
complicated.  Consider a hierarchy where ``projA`` is the top level project and
it depends directly on projects ``projB`` and ``projC``.  Both ``projB`` and
``projC`` can be built standalone and they also both depend on another project
``projD``.  ``projB`` additionally depends on ``projE``.  This example assumes
that all five projects are available on a company git server.  The
``CMakeLists.txt`` of each project might have sections like the following:

*projA*:

 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projB
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projB.git
   GIT_TAG        4a89dc7e24ff212a7b5167bef7ab079d
 )
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projC
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projC.git
   GIT_TAG        4ad4016bd1d8d5412d135cf8ceea1bb9
 )
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projD
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projD.git
   GIT_TAG        origin/integrationBranch
 )
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projE
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projE.git
   GIT_TAG        origin/release/2.3-rc1
 )

 # Order is important, see notes in the discussion further below
 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(projD projB projC)

*projB*:

 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projD
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projD.git
   GIT_TAG        20b415f9034bbd2a2e8216e9a5c9e632
 )
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projE
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projE.git
   GIT_TAG        68e20f674a48be38d60e129f600faf7d
 )

 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(projD projE)

*projC*:

 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projD
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projD.git
   GIT_TAG        7d9a17ad2c962aa13e2fbb8043fb6b8a
 )

 # This particular version of projD requires workarounds
 FetchContent_GetProperties(projD)
 if(NOT projd_POPULATED)
   FetchContent_Populate(projD)

   # Copy an additional/replacement file into the populated source
   file(COPY someFile.c DESTINATION ${projd_SOURCE_DIR}/src)

   add_subdirectory(${projd_SOURCE_DIR} ${projd_BINARY_DIR})
 endif()

A few key points should be noted in the above:

- ``projB`` and ``projC`` define different content details for ``projD``,
  but ``projA`` also defines a set of content details for ``projD``.
  Because ``projA`` will define them first, the details from ``projB`` and
  ``projC`` will not be used.  The override details defined by ``projA``
  are not required to match either of those from ``projB`` or ``projC``, but
  it is up to the higher level project to ensure that the details it does
  define still make sense for the child projects.
- In the ``projA`` call to ``FetchContent_MakeAvailable()``, ``projD``
  is listed ahead of ``projB`` and ``projC`` to ensure that ``projA`` is in
  control of how ``projD`` is populated.
- While ``projA`` defines content details for ``projE``, it does not need
  to explicitly call ``FetchContent_MakeAvailable(projE)`` or
  ``FetchContent_Populate(projD)`` itself.  Instead, it leaves that to the
  child ``projB``.  For higher level projects, it is often enough to just
  define the override content details and leave the actual population to the
  child projects.  This saves repeating the same thing at each level of the
  project hierarchy unnecessarily.


Projects don't always need to add the populated content to the build.
Sometimes the project just wants to make the downloaded content available at
a predictable location.  The next example ensures that a set of standard
company toolchain files (and potentially even the toolchain binaries
themselves) is available early enough to be used for that same build.

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)

 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Declare(
   mycom_toolchains
   URL  https://intranet.mycompany.com//toolchains_1.3.2.tar.gz
 )
 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(mycom_toolchains)

 project(CrossCompileExample)

The project could be configured to use one of the downloaded toolchains like
so:

 cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=_deps/mycom_toolchains-src/toolchain_arm.cmake /path/to/src

When CMake processes the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, it will download and unpack
the tarball into ``_deps/mycompany_toolchains-src`` relative to the build
directory.  The ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` variable is not used until
the ``project()`` command is reached, at which point CMake looks for the
named toolchain file relative to the build directory.  Because the tarball has
already been downloaded and unpacked by then, the toolchain file will be in
place, even the very first time that ``cmake`` is run in the build directory.

Lastly, the following example demonstrates how one might download and unpack a
firmware tarball using CMake's ``script mode``.  The call to
``FetchContent_Populate()`` specifies all the content details and the
unpacked firmware will be placed in a ``firmware`` directory below the
current working directory.

*getFirmware.cmake*:

 # NOTE: Intended to be run in script mode with cmake -P
 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Populate(
   firmware
   URL        https://mycompany.com/assets/firmware-1.23-arm.tar.gz
   URL_HASH   MD5=68247684da89b608d466253762b0ff11
   SOURCE_DIR firmware
 )

FindPackageHandleStandardArgs
-----------------------------

This module provides a function intended to be used in :ref:`Find Modules`
implementing ``find_package(<PackageName>)`` calls.  It handles the
``REQUIRED``, ``QUIET`` and version-related arguments of ``find_package``.
It also sets the ``<PackageName>_FOUND`` variable.  The package is
considered found if all variables listed contain valid results, e.g.
valid filepaths.

.. command:: find_package_handle_standard_args

  There are two signatures::

   find_package_handle_standard_args(<PackageName>
     (DEFAULT_MSG|<custom-failure-message>)
     <required-var>...
     )

   find_package_handle_standard_args(<PackageName>
     [FOUND_VAR <result-var>]
     [REQUIRED_VARS <required-var>...]
     [VERSION_VAR <version-var>]
     [HANDLE_COMPONENTS]
     [CONFIG_MODE]
     [FAIL_MESSAGE <custom-failure-message>]
     )

 The ``<PackageName>_FOUND`` variable will be set to ``TRUE`` if all
 the variables ``<required-var>...`` are valid and any optional
 constraints are satisfied, and ``FALSE`` otherwise.  A success or
 failure message may be displayed based on the results and on
 whether the ``REQUIRED`` and/or ``QUIET`` option was given to
 the :command:`find_package` call.

 The options are:

 ``(DEFAULT_MSG|<custom-failure-message>)``
   In the simple signature this specifies the failure message.
   Use ``DEFAULT_MSG`` to ask for a default message to be computed
   (recommended).  Not valid in the full signature.

 ``FOUND_VAR <result-var>``
   Obsolete.  Specifies either ``<PackageName>_FOUND`` or
   ``<PACKAGENAME>_FOUND`` as the result variable.  This exists only
   for compatibility with older versions of CMake and is now ignored.
   Result variables of both names are always set for compatibility.

 ``REQUIRED_VARS <required-var>...``
   Specify the variables which are required for this package.
   These may be named in the generated failure message asking the
   user to set the missing variable values.  Therefore these should
   typically be cache entries such as ``FOO_LIBRARY`` and not output
   variables like ``FOO_LIBRARIES``.

 ``VERSION_VAR <version-var>``
   Specify the name of a variable that holds the version of the package
   that has been found.  This version will be checked against the
   (potentially) specified required version given to the
   :command:`find_package` call, including its ``EXACT`` option.
   The default messages include information about the required
   version and the version which has been actually found, both
   if the version is ok or not.

 ``HANDLE_COMPONENTS``
   Enable handling of package components.  In this case, the command
   will report which components have been found and which are missing,
   and the ``<PackageName>_FOUND`` variable will be set to ``FALSE``
   if any of the required components (i.e. not the ones listed after
   the ``OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS`` option of :command:`find_package`) are
   missing.

 ``CONFIG_MODE``
   Specify that the calling find module is a wrapper around a
   call to ``find_package(<PackageName> NO_MODULE)``.  This implies
   a ``VERSION_VAR`` value of ``<PackageName>_VERSION``.  The command
   will automatically check whether the package configuration file
   was found.

 ``FAIL_MESSAGE <custom-failure-message>``
   Specify a custom failure message instead of using the default
   generated message.  Not recommended.

Example for the simple signature:

 find_package_handle_standard_args(LibXml2 DEFAULT_MSG
   LIBXML2_LIBRARY LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)

The ``LibXml2`` package is considered to be found if both
``LIBXML2_LIBRARY`` and ``LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR`` are valid.
Then also ``LibXml2_FOUND`` is set to ``TRUE``.  If it is not found
and ``REQUIRED`` was used, it fails with a
``message(FATAL_ERROR)``, independent whether ``QUIET`` was
used or not.  If it is found, success will be reported, including
the content of the first ``<required-var>``.  On repeated CMake runs,
the same message will not be printed again.

Example for the full signature:

 find_package_handle_standard_args(LibArchive
   REQUIRED_VARS LibArchive_LIBRARY LibArchive_INCLUDE_DIR
   VERSION_VAR LibArchive_VERSION)

In this case, the ``LibArchive`` package is considered to be found if
both ``LibArchive_LIBRARY`` and ``LibArchive_INCLUDE_DIR`` are valid.
Also the version of ``LibArchive`` will be checked by using the version
contained in ``LibArchive_VERSION``.  Since no ``FAIL_MESSAGE`` is given,
the default messages will be printed.

Another example for the full signature:

 find_package(Automoc4 QUIET NO_MODULE HINTS /opt/automoc4)
 find_package_handle_standard_args(Automoc4  CONFIG_MODE)

In this case, a ``FindAutmoc4.cmake`` module wraps a call to
``find_package(Automoc4 NO_MODULE)`` and adds an additional search
directory for ``automoc4``.  Then the call to
``find_package_handle_standard_args`` produces a proper success/failure
message.

FindPackageMessage
------------------

 find_package_message(<name> "message for user" "find result details")

This function is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files.
It will print a message once for each unique find result.  This is
useful for telling the user where a package was found.  The first
argument specifies the name (XXX) of the package.  The second argument
specifies the message to display.  The third argument lists details
about the find result so that if they change the message will be
displayed again.  The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to the
find_package command.

Example:

 if(X11_FOUND)
   find_package_message(X11 "Found X11: ${X11_X11_LIB}"
     "[${X11_X11_LIB}][${X11_INCLUDE_DIR}]")
 else()
  ...
 endif()

FortranCInterface
-----------------

Fortran/C Interface Detection

This module automatically detects the API by which C and Fortran
languages interact.

Module Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variables that indicate if the mangling is found:

``FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND``
  Global subroutines and functions.

``FortranCInterface_MODULE_FOUND``
  Module subroutines and functions (declared by "MODULE PROCEDURE").

This module also provides the following variables to specify
the detected mangling, though a typical use case does not need
to reference them and can use the Module Functions below.

``FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_PREFIX``
  Prefix for a global symbol without an underscore.

``FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SUFFIX``
  Suffix for a global symbol without an underscore.

Module Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: FortranCInterface_HEADER

  The ``FortranCInterface_HEADER`` function is provided to generate a
  C header file containing macros to mangle symbol names::

   FortranCInterface_HEADER(<file>
                            [MACRO_NAMESPACE <macro-ns>]
                            [SYMBOL_NAMESPACE <ns>]
                            [SYMBOLS [<module>:]<function> ...])

 It generates in ``<file>`` definitions of the following macros::

    #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL (name,NAME) ...
    #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_(name,NAME) ...
    #define FortranCInterface_MODULE (mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
    #define FortranCInterface_MODULE_(mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...

 These macros mangle four categories of Fortran symbols, respectively:

 * Global symbols without '_': ``call mysub()``
 * Global symbols with '_'   : ``call my_sub()``
 * Module symbols without '_': ``use mymod; call mysub()``
 * Module symbols with '_'   : ``use mymod; call my_sub()``

 If mangling for a category is not known, its macro is left undefined.
 All macros require raw names in both lower case and upper case.

 The options are:

 ``MACRO_NAMESPACE``
   Replace the default ``FortranCInterface_`` prefix with a given
   namespace ``<macro-ns>``.

 ``SYMBOLS``
   List symbols to mangle automatically with C preprocessor definitions::

     <function>          ==> #define <ns><function> ...
     <module>:<function> ==> #define <ns><module>_<function> ...

   If the mangling for some symbol is not known then no preprocessor
   definition is created, and a warning is displayed.

 ``SYMBOL_NAMESPACE``
   Prefix all preprocessor definitions generated by the ``SYMBOLS``
   option with a given namespace ``<ns>``.

.. command:: FortranCInterface_VERIFY

  The ``FortranCInterface_VERIFY`` function is provided to verify
  that the Fortran and C/C++ compilers work together::

   FortranCInterface_VERIFY([CXX] [QUIET])

 It tests whether a simple test executable using Fortran and C (and C++
 when the CXX option is given) compiles and links successfully.  The
 result is stored in the cache entry ``FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_C``
 (or ``FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_CXX`` if ``CXX`` is given) as a boolean.
 If the check fails and ``QUIET`` is not given the function terminates with a
 fatal error message describing the problem.  The purpose of this check
 is to stop a build early for incompatible compiler combinations.  The
 test is built in the ``Release`` configuration.

Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 include(FortranCInterface)
 FortranCInterface_HEADER(FC.h MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_")

This creates a "FC.h" header that defines mangling macros ``FC_GLOBAL()``,
``FC_GLOBAL_()``, ``FC_MODULE()``, and ``FC_MODULE_()``.

 include(FortranCInterface)
 FortranCInterface_HEADER(FCMangle.h
                          MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                          SYMBOL_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                          SYMBOLS mysub mymod:my_sub)

This creates a "FCMangle.h" header that defines the same ``FC_*()``
mangling macros as the previous example plus preprocessor symbols
``FC_mysub`` and ``FC_mymod_my_sub``.

Additional Manglings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FortranCInterface is aware of possible ``GLOBAL`` and ``MODULE`` manglings
for many Fortran compilers, but it also provides an interface to specify
new possible manglings.  Set the variables::

 FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
 FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS

before including FortranCInterface to specify manglings of the symbols
``MySub``, ``My_Sub``, ``MyModule:MySub``, and ``My_Module:My_Sub``.
For example, the code:

 set(FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS mysub_ my_sub__ MYSUB_)
   #                                  ^^^^^  ^^^^^^   ^^^^^
 set(FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS
     __mymodule_MOD_mysub __my_module_MOD_my_sub)
   #   ^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^
 include(FortranCInterface)

tells FortranCInterface to try given ``GLOBAL`` and ``MODULE`` manglings.
(The carets point at raw symbol names for clarity in this example but
are not needed.)

GenerateExportHeader
--------------------

Function for generation of export macros for libraries

This module provides the function GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER().

The ``GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER`` function can be used to generate a file
suitable for preprocessor inclusion which contains EXPORT macros to be
used in library classes::

 GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER( LIBRARY_TARGET
           [BASE_NAME <base_name>]
           [EXPORT_MACRO_NAME <export_macro_name>]
           [EXPORT_FILE_NAME <export_file_name>]
           [DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME <deprecated_macro_name>]
           [NO_EXPORT_MACRO_NAME <no_export_macro_name>]
           [INCLUDE_GUARD_NAME <include_guard_name>]
           [STATIC_DEFINE <static_define>]
           [NO_DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME <no_deprecated_macro_name>]
           [DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED]
           [PREFIX_NAME <prefix_name>]
           [CUSTOM_CONTENT_FROM_VARIABLE <variable>]
 )

The target properties ``CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET <<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET>``
and ``VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN`` can be used to add the appropriate
compile flags for targets.  See the documentation of those target properties,
and the convenience variables
``CMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET`` and
``CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN``.

By default ``GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER()`` generates macro names in a file
name determined by the name of the library.  This means that in the
simplest case, users of ``GenerateExportHeader`` will be equivalent to:

 set(CMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden)
 set(CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN 1)
 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
 generate_export_header(somelib)
 install(TARGETS somelib DESTINATION ${LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR})
 install(FILES
  someclass.h
  ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/somelib_export.h DESTINATION ${INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR}
 )

And in the ABI header files:

 #include "somelib_export.h"
 class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass {
   ...
 };

The CMake fragment will generate a file in the
``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}`` called ``somelib_export.h`` containing the
macros ``SOMELIB_EXPORT``, ``SOMELIB_NO_EXPORT``, ``SOMELIB_DEPRECATED``,
``SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_EXPORT`` and ``SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_NO_EXPORT``.
They will be followed by content taken from the variable specified by
the ``CUSTOM_CONTENT_FROM_VARIABLE`` option, if any.
The resulting file should be installed with other headers in the library.

The ``BASE_NAME`` argument can be used to override the file name and the
names used for the macros:

 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
 generate_export_header(somelib
   BASE_NAME other_name
 )

Generates a file called ``other_name_export.h`` containing the macros
``OTHER_NAME_EXPORT``, ``OTHER_NAME_NO_EXPORT`` and ``OTHER_NAME_DEPRECATED``
etc.

The ``BASE_NAME`` may be overridden by specifying other options in the
function.  For example:

 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
 generate_export_header(somelib
   EXPORT_MACRO_NAME OTHER_NAME_EXPORT
 )

creates the macro ``OTHER_NAME_EXPORT`` instead of ``SOMELIB_EXPORT``, but
other macros and the generated file name is as default:

 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
 generate_export_header(somelib
   DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME KDE_DEPRECATED
 )

creates the macro ``KDE_DEPRECATED`` instead of ``SOMELIB_DEPRECATED``.

If ``LIBRARY_TARGET`` is a static library, macros are defined without
values.

If the same sources are used to create both a shared and a static
library, the uppercased symbol ``${BASE_NAME}_STATIC_DEFINE`` should be
used when building the static library:

 add_library(shared_variant SHARED ${lib_SRCS})
 add_library(static_variant ${lib_SRCS})
 generate_export_header(shared_variant BASE_NAME libshared_and_static)
 set_target_properties(static_variant PROPERTIES
   COMPILE_FLAGS -DLIBSHARED_AND_STATIC_STATIC_DEFINE)

This will cause the export macros to expand to nothing when building
the static library.

If ``DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED`` is specified, then a macro
``${BASE_NAME}_NO_DEPRECATED`` will be defined This macro can be used to
remove deprecated code from preprocessor output:

 option(EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED "Exclude deprecated parts of the library" FALSE)
 if (EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED)
   set(NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED)
 endif()
 generate_export_header(somelib ${NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED})

And then in somelib:

 class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass
 {
 public:
 #ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED
   SOMELIB_DEPRECATED void oldMethod();
 #endif
 };

 #ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED
 void SomeClass::oldMethod() {  }
 #endif

If ``PREFIX_NAME`` is specified, the argument will be used as a prefix to
all generated macros.

For example:

 generate_export_header(somelib PREFIX_NAME VTK_)

Generates the macros ``VTK_SOMELIB_EXPORT`` etc.

::

 ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS( [<output_variable>] )

The ``ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS`` function adds ``-fvisibility=hidden`` to
``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`` if supported, and is a no-op
on Windows which does not need extra compiler flags for exporting support.
You may optionally pass a single argument to ``ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS``
that will be populated with the ``CXX_FLAGS`` required to enable visibility
support for the compiler/architecture in use.

This function is deprecated.  Set the target properties
``CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET <<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET>`` and
``VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN`` instead.

GetPrerequisites
----------------

Functions to analyze and list executable file prerequisites.

This module provides functions to list the .dll, .dylib or .so files
that an executable or shared library file depends on.  (Its
prerequisites.)

It uses various tools to obtain the list of required shared library
files:

::

 dumpbin (Windows)
 objdump (MinGW on Windows)
 ldd (Linux/Unix)
 otool (Mac OSX)

The following functions are provided by this module:

::

 get_prerequisites
 list_prerequisites
 list_prerequisites_by_glob
 gp_append_unique
 is_file_executable
 gp_item_default_embedded_path
   (projects can override with gp_item_default_embedded_path_override)
 gp_resolve_item
   (projects can override with gp_resolve_item_override)
 gp_resolved_file_type
   (projects can override with gp_resolved_file_type_override)
 gp_file_type

Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function, break, return
and PARENT_SCOPE.

::

 GET_PREREQUISITES(<target> <prerequisites_var> <exclude_system> <recurse>
                   <exepath> <dirs> [<rpaths>])

Get the list of shared library files required by <target>.  The list
in the variable named <prerequisites_var> should be empty on first
entry to this function.  On exit, <prerequisites_var> will contain the
list of required shared library files.

<target> is the full path to an executable file.  <prerequisites_var>
is the name of a CMake variable to contain the results.
<exclude_system> must be 0 or 1 indicating whether to include or
exclude "system" prerequisites.  If <recurse> is set to 1 all
prerequisites will be found recursively, if set to 0 only direct
prerequisites are listed.  <exepath> is the path to the top level
executable used for @executable_path replacment on the Mac.  <dirs> is
a list of paths where libraries might be found: these paths are
searched first when a target without any path info is given.  Then
standard system locations are also searched: PATH, Framework
locations, /usr/lib...

The variable GET_PREREQUISITES_VERBOSE can be set to true to enable verbose
output.

::

 LIST_PREREQUISITES(<target> [<recurse> [<exclude_system> [<verbose>]]])

Print a message listing the prerequisites of <target>.

<target> is the name of a shared library or executable target or the
full path to a shared library or executable file.  If <recurse> is set
to 1 all prerequisites will be found recursively, if set to 0 only
direct prerequisites are listed.  <exclude_system> must be 0 or 1
indicating whether to include or exclude "system" prerequisites.  With
<verbose> set to 0 only the full path names of the prerequisites are
printed, set to 1 extra informatin will be displayed.

::

 LIST_PREREQUISITES_BY_GLOB(<glob_arg> <glob_exp>)

Print the prerequisites of shared library and executable files
matching a globbing pattern.  <glob_arg> is GLOB or GLOB_RECURSE and
<glob_exp> is a globbing expression used with "file(GLOB" or
"file(GLOB_RECURSE" to retrieve a list of matching files.  If a
matching file is executable, its prerequisites are listed.

Any additional (optional) arguments provided are passed along as the
optional arguments to the list_prerequisites calls.

::

 GP_APPEND_UNIQUE(<list_var> <value>)

Append <value> to the list variable <list_var> only if the value is
not already in the list.

::

 IS_FILE_EXECUTABLE(<file> <result_var>)

Return 1 in <result_var> if <file> is a binary executable, 0
otherwise.

::

 GP_ITEM_DEFAULT_EMBEDDED_PATH(<item> <default_embedded_path_var>)

Return the path that others should refer to the item by when the item
is embedded inside a bundle.

Override on a per-project basis by providing a project-specific
gp_item_default_embedded_path_override function.

::

 GP_RESOLVE_ITEM(<context> <item> <exepath> <dirs> <resolved_item_var>
                 [<rpaths>])

Resolve an item into an existing full path file.

Override on a per-project basis by providing a project-specific
gp_resolve_item_override function.

::

 GP_RESOLVED_FILE_TYPE(<original_file> <file> <exepath> <dirs> <type_var>
                       [<rpaths>])

Return the type of <file> with respect to <original_file>.  String
describing type of prerequisite is returned in variable named
<type_var>.

Use <exepath> and <dirs> if necessary to resolve non-absolute <file>
values -- but only for non-embedded items.

Possible types are:

::

 system
 local
 embedded
 other

Override on a per-project basis by providing a project-specific
gp_resolved_file_type_override function.

::

 GP_FILE_TYPE(<original_file> <file> <type_var>)

Return the type of <file> with respect to <original_file>.  String
describing type of prerequisite is returned in variable named
<type_var>.

Possible types are:

::

 system

GNUInstallDirs
--------------

Define GNU standard installation directories

Provides install directory variables as defined by the
GNU Coding Standards.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inclusion of this module defines the following variables:

``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>``

  Destination for files of a given type.  This value may be passed to
  the ``DESTINATION`` options of ``install()`` commands for the
  corresponding file type.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir>``

  The absolute path generated from the corresponding ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>``
  value.  If the value is not already an absolute path, an absolute path
  is constructed typically by prepending the value of the
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` variable.  However, there are some
  special cases as documented below.

where ``<dir>`` is one of:

``BINDIR``
  user executables (``bin``)
``SBINDIR``
  system admin executables (``sbin``)
``LIBEXECDIR``
  program executables (``libexec``)
``SYSCONFDIR``
  read-only single-machine data (``etc``)
``SHAREDSTATEDIR``
  modifiable architecture-independent data (``com``)
``LOCALSTATEDIR``
  modifiable single-machine data (``var``)
``RUNSTATEDIR``
  run-time variable data (``LOCALSTATEDIR/run``)
``LIBDIR``
  object code libraries (``lib`` or ``lib64``
  or ``lib/<multiarch-tuple>`` on Debian)
``INCLUDEDIR``
  C header files (``include``)
``OLDINCLUDEDIR``
  C header files for non-gcc (``/usr/include``)
``DATAROOTDIR``
  read-only architecture-independent data root (``share``)
``DATADIR``
  read-only architecture-independent data (``DATAROOTDIR``)
``INFODIR``
  info documentation (``DATAROOTDIR/info``)
``LOCALEDIR``
  locale-dependent data (``DATAROOTDIR/locale``)
``MANDIR``
  man documentation (``DATAROOTDIR/man``)
``DOCDIR``
  documentation root (``DATAROOTDIR/doc/PROJECT_NAME``)

If the includer does not define a value the above-shown default will be
used and the value will appear in the cache for editing by the user.

Special Cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following values of ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` are special:

``/``

  For ``<dir>`` other than the ``SYSCONFDIR``, ``LOCALSTATEDIR`` and
  ``RUNSTATEDIR``, the value of ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>`` is prefixed
  with ``usr/`` if it is not user-specified as an absolute path.
  For example, the ``INCLUDEDIR`` value ``include`` becomes ``usr/include``.
  This is required by the GNU Coding Standards, which state:

    When building the complete GNU system, the prefix will be empty
    and ``/usr`` will be a symbolic link to ``/``.

``/usr``

  For ``<dir>`` equal to ``SYSCONFDIR``, ``LOCALSTATEDIR`` or
  ``RUNSTATEDIR``, the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir>`` is computed by
  prepending just ``/`` to the value of ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>``
  if it is not user-specified as an absolute path.
  For example, the ``SYSCONFDIR`` value ``etc`` becomes ``/etc``.
  This is required by the GNU Coding Standards.

``/opt/...``

  For ``<dir>`` equal to ``SYSCONFDIR``, ``LOCALSTATEDIR`` or
  ``RUNSTATEDIR``, the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir>`` is computed by
  *appending* the prefix to the value of ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>``
  if it is not user-specified as an absolute path.
  For example, the ``SYSCONFDIR`` value ``etc`` becomes ``/etc/opt/...``.
  This is defined by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

Macros
^^^^^^

.. command:: GNUInstallDirs_get_absolute_install_dir

  ::

   GNUInstallDirs_get_absolute_install_dir(absvar var)

 Set the given variable ``absvar`` to the absolute path contained
 within the variable ``var``.  This is to allow the computation of an
 absolute path, accounting for all the special cases documented
 above.  While this macro is used to compute the various
 ``CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir>`` variables, it is exposed publicly to
 allow users who create additional path variables to also compute
 absolute paths where necessary, using the same logic.

GoogleTest
----------

This module defines functions to help use the Google Test infrastructure.  Two
mechanisms for adding tests are provided. ``gtest_add_tests()`` has been
around for some time, originally via ``find_package(GTest)``.
``gtest_discover_tests()`` was introduced in CMake 3.10.

The (older) ``gtest_add_tests()`` scans source files to identify tests.
This is usually effective, with some caveats, including in cross-compiling
environments, and makes setting additional properties on tests more convenient.
However, its handling of parameterized tests is less comprehensive, and it
requires re-running CMake to detect changes to the list of tests.

The (newer) ``gtest_discover_tests()`` discovers tests by asking the
compiled test executable to enumerate its tests.  This is more robust and
provides better handling of parameterized tests, and does not require CMake
to be re-run when tests change.  However, it may not work in a cross-compiling
environment, and setting test properties is less convenient.

More details can be found in the documentation of the respective functions.

Both commands are intended to replace use of ``add_test()`` to register
tests, and will create a separate CTest test for each Google Test test case.
Note that this is in some cases less efficient, as common set-up and tear-down
logic cannot be shared by multiple test cases executing in the same instance.
However, it provides more fine-grained pass/fail information to CTest, which is
usually considered as more beneficial.  By default, the CTest test name is the
same as the Google Test name (i.e. ``suite.testcase``); see also
``TEST_PREFIX`` and ``TEST_SUFFIX``.

.. command:: gtest_add_tests

  Automatically add tests with CTest by scanning source code for Google Test
  macros::

   gtest_add_tests(TARGET target
                   [SOURCES src1...]
                   [EXTRA_ARGS arg1...]
                   [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                   [TEST_PREFIX prefix]
                   [TEST_SUFFIX suffix]
                   [SKIP_DEPENDENCY]
                   [TEST_LIST outVar]
   )

 ``gtest_add_tests`` attempts to identify tests by scanning source files.
 Although this is generally effective, it uses only a basic regular expression
 match, which can be defeated by atypical test declarations, and is unable to
 fully "split" parameterized tests.  Additionally, it requires that CMake be
 re-run to discover any newly added, removed or renamed tests (by default,
 this means that CMake is re-run when any test source file is changed, but see
 ``SKIP_DEPENDENCY``).  However, it has the advantage of declaring tests at
 CMake time, which somewhat simplifies setting additional properties on tests,
 and always works in a cross-compiling environment.

 The options are:

 ``TARGET target``
   Specifies the Google Test executable, which must be a known CMake
   executable target.  CMake will substitute the location of the built
   executable when running the test.

 ``SOURCES src1...``
   When provided, only the listed files will be scanned for test cases.  If
   this option is not given, the :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` property of the
   specified ``target`` will be used to obtain the list of sources.

 ``EXTRA_ARGS arg1...``
   Any extra arguments to pass on the command line to each test case.

 ``WORKING_DIRECTORY dir``
   Specifies the directory in which to run the discovered test cases.  If this
   option is not provided, the current binary directory is used.

 ``TEST_PREFIX prefix``
   Specifies a ``prefix`` to be prepended to the name of each discovered test
   case.  This can be useful when the same source files are being used in
   multiple calls to ``gtest_add_test()`` but with different ``EXTRA_ARGS``.

 ``TEST_SUFFIX suffix``
   Similar to ``TEST_PREFIX`` except the ``suffix`` is appended to the name of
   every discovered test case.  Both ``TEST_PREFIX`` and ``TEST_SUFFIX`` may
   be specified.

 ``SKIP_DEPENDENCY``
   Normally, the function creates a dependency which will cause CMake to be
   re-run if any of the sources being scanned are changed.  This is to ensure
   that the list of discovered tests is updated.  If this behavior is not
   desired (as may be the case while actually writing the test cases), this
   option can be used to prevent the dependency from being added.

 ``TEST_LIST outVar``
   The variable named by ``outVar`` will be populated in the calling scope
   with the list of discovered test cases.  This allows the caller to do
   things like manipulate test properties of the discovered tests.

 .. code-block:: cmake

   include(GoogleTest)
   add_executable(FooTest FooUnitTest.cxx)
   gtest_add_tests(TARGET      FooTest
                   TEST_SUFFIX .noArgs
                   TEST_LIST   noArgsTests
   )
   gtest_add_tests(TARGET      FooTest
                   EXTRA_ARGS  --someArg someValue
                   TEST_SUFFIX .withArgs
                   TEST_LIST   withArgsTests
   )
   set_tests_properties(${noArgsTests}   PROPERTIES TIMEOUT 10)
   set_tests_properties(${withArgsTests} PROPERTIES TIMEOUT 20)

 For backward compatibility, the following form is also supported::

   gtest_add_tests(exe args files...)

 ``exe``
   The path to the test executable or the name of a CMake target.
 ``args``
   A ;-list of extra arguments to be passed to executable.  The entire
   list must be passed as a single argument.  Enclose it in quotes,
   or pass ``""`` for no arguments.
 ``files...``
   A list of source files to search for tests and test fixtures.
   Alternatively, use ``AUTO`` to specify that ``exe`` is the name
   of a CMake executable target whose sources should be scanned.

 .. code-block:: cmake

   include(GoogleTest)
   set(FooTestArgs --foo 1 --bar 2)
   add_executable(FooTest FooUnitTest.cxx)
   gtest_add_tests(FooTest "${FooTestArgs}" AUTO)

.. command:: gtest_discover_tests

  Automatically add tests with CTest by querying the compiled test executable
  for available tests::

   gtest_discover_tests(target
                        [EXTRA_ARGS arg1...]
                        [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                        [TEST_PREFIX prefix]
                        [TEST_SUFFIX suffix]
                        [NO_PRETTY_TYPES] [NO_PRETTY_VALUES]
                        [PROPERTIES name1 value1...]
                        [TEST_LIST var]
                        [DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT seconds]
   )

 ``gtest_discover_tests`` sets up a post-build command on the test executable
 that generates the list of tests by parsing the output from running the test
 with the ``--gtest_list_tests`` argument.  Compared to the source parsing
 approach of :command:`gtest_add_tests`, this ensures that the full list of
 tests, including instantiations of parameterized tests, is obtained.  Since
 test discovery occurs at build time, it is not necessary to re-run CMake when
 the list of tests changes.
 However, it requires that :prop_tgt:`CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` is properly set
 in order to function in a cross-compiling environment.

 Additionally, setting properties on tests is somewhat less convenient, since
 the tests are not available at CMake time.  Additional test properties may be
 assigned to the set of tests as a whole using the ``PROPERTIES`` option.  If
 more fine-grained test control is needed, custom content may be provided
 through an external CTest script using the :prop_dir:`TEST_INCLUDE_FILES`
 directory property.  The set of discovered tests is made accessible to such a
 script via the ``<target>_TESTS`` variable.

 The options are:

 ``target``
   Specifies the Google Test executable, which must be a known CMake
   executable target.  CMake will substitute the location of the built
   executable when running the test.

 ``EXTRA_ARGS arg1...``
   Any extra arguments to pass on the command line to each test case.

 ``WORKING_DIRECTORY dir``
   Specifies the directory in which to run the discovered test cases.  If this
   option is not provided, the current binary directory is used.

 ``TEST_PREFIX prefix``
   Specifies a ``prefix`` to be prepended to the name of each discovered test
   case.  This can be useful when the same test executable is being used in
   multiple calls to ``gtest_discover_tests()`` but with different
   ``EXTRA_ARGS``.

 ``TEST_SUFFIX suffix``
   Similar to ``TEST_PREFIX`` except the ``suffix`` is appended to the name of
   every discovered test case.  Both ``TEST_PREFIX`` and ``TEST_SUFFIX`` may
   be specified.

 ``NO_PRETTY_TYPES``
   By default, the type index of type-parameterized tests is replaced by the
   actual type name in the CTest test name.  If this behavior is undesirable
   (e.g. because the type names are unwieldy), this option will suppress this
   behavior.

 ``NO_PRETTY_VALUES``
   By default, the value index of value-parameterized tests is replaced by the
   actual value in the CTest test name.  If this behavior is undesirable
   (e.g. because the value strings are unwieldy), this option will suppress
   this behavior.

 ``PROPERTIES name1 value1...``
   Specifies additional properties to be set on all tests discovered by this
   invocation of ``gtest_discover_tests``.

 ``TEST_LIST var``
   Make the list of tests available in the variable ``var``, rather than the
   default ``<target>_TESTS``.  This can be useful when the same test
   executable is being used in multiple calls to ``gtest_discover_tests()``.
   Note that this variable is only available in CTest.

 ``DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT num``
   Specifies how long (in seconds) CMake will wait for the test to enumerate
   available tests.  If the test takes longer than this, discovery (and your
   build) will fail.  Most test executables will enumerate their tests very
   quickly, but under some exceptional circumstances, a test may require a
   longer timeout.  The default is 5.  See also the ``TIMEOUT`` option of
   :command:`execute_process`.

   .. note::

     In CMake versions 3.10.1 and 3.10.2, this option was called ``TIMEOUT``.
     This clashed with the ``TIMEOUT`` test property, which is one of the
     common properties that would be set with the ``PROPERTIES`` keyword,
     usually leading to legal but unintended behavior.  The keyword was
     changed to ``DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT`` in CMake 3.10.3 to address this
     problem.  The ambiguous behavior of the ``TIMEOUT`` keyword in 3.10.1
     and 3.10.2 has not been preserved.

InstallRequiredSystemLibraries
------------------------------

Include this module to search for compiler-provided system runtime
libraries and add install rules for them.  Some optional variables
may be set prior to including the module to adjust behavior:

``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS``
  Specify additional runtime libraries that may not be detected.
  After inclusion any detected libraries will be appended to this.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP``
  Set to TRUE to skip calling the ``install(PROGRAMS)`` command to
  allow the includer to specify its own install rule, using the value of
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS`` to get the list of libraries.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES``
  Set to TRUE to install the debug runtime libraries when available
  with MSVC tools.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES_ONLY``
  Set to TRUE to install only the debug runtime libraries with MSVC
  tools even if the release runtime libraries are also available.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_UCRT_LIBRARIES``
  Set to TRUE to install the Windows Universal CRT libraries for
  app-local deployment (e.g. to Windows XP).  This is meaningful
  only with MSVC from Visual Studio 2015 or higher.

  One may set a ``CMAKE_WINDOWS_KITS_10_DIR`` *environment variable*
  to an absolute path to tell CMake to look for Windows 10 SDKs in
  a custom location.  The specified directory is expected to contain
  ``Redist/ucrt/DLLs/*`` directories.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES``
  Set to TRUE to install the MSVC MFC runtime libraries.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_OPENMP_LIBRARIES``
  Set to TRUE to install the MSVC OpenMP runtime libraries

``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_DESTINATION``
  Specify the ``install(PROGRAMS)`` command ``DESTINATION``
  option.  If not specified, the default is ``bin`` on Windows
  and ``lib`` elsewhere.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS``
  Set to TRUE to disable warnings about required library files that
  do not exist.  (For example, Visual Studio Express editions may
  not provide the redistributable files.)

``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_COMPONENT``
  Specify the ``install(PROGRAMS)`` command ``COMPONENT``
  option.  If not specified, no such option will be used.

ProcessorCount
--------------

ProcessorCount(var)

Determine the number of processors/cores and save value in ${var}

Sets the variable named ${var} to the number of physical cores
available on the machine if the information can be determined.
Otherwise it is set to 0.  Currently this functionality is implemented
for AIX, cygwin, FreeBSD, HPUX, Linux, macOS, QNX, Sun and
Windows.

This function is guaranteed to return a positive integer (>=1) if it
succeeds.  It returns 0 if there's a problem determining the processor
count.

Example use, in a ctest -S dashboard script:

::

 include(ProcessorCount)
 ProcessorCount(N)
 if(NOT N EQUAL 0)
   set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS -j${N})
   set(ctest_test_args ${ctest_test_args} PARALLEL_LEVEL ${N})
 endif()

This function is intended to offer an approximation of the value of
the number of compute cores available on the current machine, such
that you may use that value for parallel building and parallel
testing.  It is meant to help utilize as much of the machine as seems
reasonable.  Of course, knowledge of what else might be running on the
machine simultaneously should be used when deciding whether to request
a machine's full capacity all for yourself.

SelectLibraryConfigurations
---------------------------

 select_library_configurations(basename)

This macro takes a library base name as an argument, and will choose
good values for the variables

::

 basename_LIBRARY
 basename_LIBRARIES
 basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG
 basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE

depending on what has been found and set.

If only ``basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE`` is defined, ``basename_LIBRARY`` will
be set to the release value, and ``basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG`` will be set
to ``basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND``.  If only ``basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG``
is defined, then ``basename_LIBRARY`` will take the debug value, and
``basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE`` will be set to ``basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE-NOTFOUND``.

If the generator supports configuration types, then ``basename_LIBRARY``
and ``basename_LIBRARIES`` will be set with debug and optimized flags
specifying the library to be used for the given configuration.  If no
build type has been set or the generator in use does not support
configuration types, then ``basename_LIBRARY`` and ``basename_LIBRARIES``
will take only the release value, or the debug value if the release one
is not set.

SquishTestScript
----------------





This script launches a GUI test using Squish.  You should not call the
script directly; instead, you should access it via the SQUISH_ADD_TEST
macro that is defined in FindSquish.cmake.

This script starts the Squish server, launches the test on the client,
and finally stops the squish server.  If any of these steps fail
(including if the tests do not pass) then a fatal error is raised.

TestBigEndian
-------------

Define macro to determine endian type

Check if the system is big endian or little endian

::

 TEST_BIG_ENDIAN(VARIABLE)
 VARIABLE - variable to store the result to

TestForANSIForScope
-------------------

Check for ANSI for scope support

Check if the compiler restricts the scope of variables declared in a
for-init-statement to the loop body.

::

 CMAKE_NO_ANSI_FOR_SCOPE - holds result

TestForANSIStreamHeaders
------------------------

Test for compiler support of ANSI stream headers iostream, etc.

check if the compiler supports the standard ANSI iostream header
(without the .h)

::

 CMAKE_NO_ANSI_STREAM_HEADERS - defined by the results

TestForSSTREAM
--------------

Test for compiler support of ANSI sstream header

check if the compiler supports the standard ANSI sstream header

::

 CMAKE_NO_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - defined by the results

TestForSTDNamespace
-------------------

Test for std:: namespace support

check if the compiler supports std:: on stl classes

::

 CMAKE_NO_STD_NAMESPACE - defined by the results

UseEcos
-------

This module defines variables and macros required to build eCos application.

This file contains the following macros:
ECOS_ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES() - add the eCos include dirs
ECOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(name source1 ...  sourceN ) - create an eCos
executable ECOS_ADJUST_DIRECTORY(VAR source1 ...  sourceN ) - adjusts
the path of the source files and puts the result into VAR

Macros for selecting the toolchain: ECOS_USE_ARM_ELF_TOOLS() - enable
the ARM ELF toolchain for the directory where it is called
ECOS_USE_I386_ELF_TOOLS() - enable the i386 ELF toolchain for the
directory where it is called ECOS_USE_PPC_EABI_TOOLS() - enable the
PowerPC toolchain for the directory where it is called

It contains the following variables: ECOS_DEFINITIONS
ECOSCONFIG_EXECUTABLE ECOS_CONFIG_FILE - defaults to ecos.ecc, if your
eCos configuration file has a different name, adjust this variable for
internal use only:

::

 ECOS_ADD_TARGET_LIB

UseJavaClassFilelist
--------------------





This script create a list of compiled Java class files to be added to
a jar file.  This avoids including cmake files which get created in
the binary directory.

UseJava
-------

Use Module for Java

This file provides functions for Java.  It is assumed that
FindJava.cmake has already been loaded.  See FindJava.cmake for
information on how to load Java into your CMake project.

::

 add_jar(target_name
         [SOURCES] source1 [source2 ...] [resource1 ...]
         [INCLUDE_JARS jar1 [jar2 ...]]
         [ENTRY_POINT entry]
         [VERSION version]
         [OUTPUT_NAME name]
         [OUTPUT_DIR dir]
         [GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS target [DESTINATION dir]]
         )

This command creates a <target_name>.jar.  It compiles the given
source files (source) and adds the given resource files (resource) to
the jar file.  Source files can be java files or listing files
(prefixed by '@').  If only resource files are given then just a jar file
is created.  The list of include jars are added to the classpath when
compiling the java sources and also to the dependencies of the target.
INCLUDE_JARS also accepts other target names created by add_jar.  For
backwards compatibility, jar files listed as sources are ignored (as
they have been since the first version of this module).

The default OUTPUT_DIR can also be changed by setting the variable
CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_OUTPUT_DIR.

Optionally, using option GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS, native header files can be generated
for methods declared as native. These files provide the connective glue that allow your
Java and C code to interact. An INTERFACE target will be created for an easy usage
of generated files. Sub-option DESTINATION can be used to specify output directory for
generated header files.

GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS option requires, at least, version 1.8 of the JDK.

Additional instructions:

::

 To add compile flags to the target you can set these flags with
 the following variable:

::

 set(CMAKE_JAVA_COMPILE_FLAGS -nowarn)

::

 To add a path or a jar file to the class path you can do this
 with the CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH variable.

::

 set(CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH /usr/share/java/shibboleet.jar)

::

 To use a different output name for the target you can set it with:

::

 add_jar(foobar foobar.java OUTPUT_NAME shibboleet.jar)

::

 To use a different output directory than CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
 you can set it with:

::

 add_jar(foobar foobar.java OUTPUT_DIR ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/bin)

::

 To define an entry point in your jar you can set it with the ENTRY_POINT
 named argument:

::

 add_jar(example ENTRY_POINT com/examples/MyProject/Main)

::

 To define a custom manifest for the jar, you can set it with the manifest
 named argument:

::

 add_jar(example MANIFEST /path/to/manifest)

::

 To add a VERSION to the target output name you can set it using
 the VERSION named argument to add_jar. This will create a jar file with the
 name shibboleet-1.0.0.jar and will create a symlink shibboleet.jar
 pointing to the jar with the version information.

::

 add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java VERSION 1.2.0)

::

 If the target is a JNI library, utilize the following commands to
 create a JNI symbolic link:

::

 set(CMAKE_JNI_TARGET TRUE)
 add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java VERSION 1.2.0)
 install_jar(shibboleet ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/shibboleet)
 install_jni_symlink(shibboleet ${JAVA_LIB_INSTALL_DIR})

::

 If a single target needs to produce more than one jar from its
 java source code, to prevent the accumulation of duplicate class
 files in subsequent jars, set/reset CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX prior
 to calling the add_jar() function:

::

 set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/foo)
 add_jar(foo foo.java)

::

 set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/bar)
 add_jar(bar bar.java)

::

 For an optimum usage of option GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS, it is recommended to
 include module JNI before any call to add_jar. The produced target for native
 headers can then be used to compile C/C++ sources with command
 target_link_libraries.

::

 find_package(JNI)
 add_jar(foo foo.java GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS foo-native)
 add_library(bar bar.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(bar PRIVATE foo-native)

Target Properties:

::

 The add_jar() function sets some target properties. You can get these
 properties with the
    get_property(TARGET <target_name> PROPERTY <propery_name>)
 command.

::

 INSTALL_FILES      The files which should be installed. This is used by
                    install_jar().
 JNI_SYMLINK        The JNI symlink which should be installed.
                    This is used by install_jni_symlink().
 JAR_FILE           The location of the jar file so that you can include
                    it.
 CLASSDIR           The directory where the class files can be found. For
                    example to use them with javah.

::

 find_jar(<VAR>
          name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
          [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
          [VERSIONS version1 [version2]]
          [DOC "cache documentation string"]
          )

This command is used to find a full path to the named jar.  A cache
entry named by <VAR> is created to stor the result of this command.
If the full path to a jar is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not repeated unless the variable is
cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND, and
the search will be attempted again next time find_jar is invoked with
the same variable.  The name of the full path to a file that is
searched for is specified by the names listed after NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.
If you require special a version of a jar file you can specify it with
the VERSIONS argument.  The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache.

::

 install_jar(target_name destination)
 install_jar(target_name DESTINATION destination [COMPONENT component])

This command installs the TARGET_NAME files to the given DESTINATION.
It should be called in the same scope as add_jar() or it will fail.

Target Properties:

::

 The install_jar() function sets the INSTALL_DESTINATION target property
 on jars so installed. This property holds the DESTINATION as described
 above, and is used by install_jar_exports(). You can get this property
 with the
    get_property(TARGET <target_name> PROPERTY INSTALL_DESTINATION)
 command.

::

 install_jni_symlink(target_name destination)
 install_jni_symlink(target_name DESTINATION destination [COMPONENT component])

This command installs the TARGET_NAME JNI symlinks to the given
DESTINATION.  It should be called in the same scope as add_jar() or it
will fail.

::

 install_jar_exports(TARGETS jars...
                     [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
                     FILE <filename>
                     DESTINATION <dir> [COMPONENT <component>])

This command installs a target export file ``<filename>`` for the named jar
targets to the given ``DESTINATION``. Its function is similar to that of
``install(EXPORTS ...)``.

::

 export_jars(TARGETS jars...
             [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
             FILE <filename>)

This command writes a target export file ``<filename>`` for the named jar
targets. Its function is similar to that of ``export(...)``.

::

 create_javadoc(<VAR>
                PACKAGES pkg1 [pkg2 ...]
                [SOURCEPATH <sourcepath>]
                [CLASSPATH <classpath>]
                [INSTALLPATH <install path>]
                [DOCTITLE "the documentation title"]
                [WINDOWTITLE "the title of the document"]
                [AUTHOR TRUE|FALSE]
                [USE TRUE|FALSE]
                [VERSION TRUE|FALSE]
                )

Create java documentation based on files or packages.  For more
details please read the javadoc manpage.

There are two main signatures for create_javadoc.  The first signature
works with package names on a path with source files:

::

 Example:
 create_javadoc(my_example_doc
   PACKAGES com.example.foo com.example.bar
   SOURCEPATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}"
   CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH}
   WINDOWTITLE "My example"
   DOCTITLE "<h1>My example</h1>"
   AUTHOR TRUE
   USE TRUE
   VERSION TRUE
 )

The second signature for create_javadoc works on a given list of
files.

::

 create_javadoc(<VAR>
                FILES file1 [file2 ...]
                [CLASSPATH <classpath>]
                [INSTALLPATH <install path>]
                [DOCTITLE "the documentation title"]
                [WINDOWTITLE "the title of the document"]
                [AUTHOR TRUE|FALSE]
                [USE TRUE|FALSE]
                [VERSION TRUE|FALSE]
               )

Example:

::

 create_javadoc(my_example_doc
   FILES ${example_SRCS}
   CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH}
   WINDOWTITLE "My example"
   DOCTITLE "<h1>My example</h1>"
   AUTHOR TRUE
   USE TRUE
   VERSION TRUE
 )

Both signatures share most of the options.  These options are the same
as what you can find in the javadoc manpage.  Please look at the
manpage for CLASSPATH, DOCTITLE, WINDOWTITLE, AUTHOR, USE and VERSION.

The documentation will be by default installed to

::

 ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/javadoc/<VAR>

if you don't set the INSTALLPATH.

::

 create_javah(TARGET <target>
              GENERATED_FILES <VAR>
              CLASSES <class>...
              [CLASSPATH <classpath>...]
              [DEPENDS <depend>...]
              [OUTPUT_NAME <path>|OUTPUT_DIR <path>]
              )

Create C header files from java classes. These files provide the connective glue
that allow your Java and C code to interact.

This command will no longer be supported starting with version 10 of the JDK due
to the suppression of javah tool.
Command ``add_jar(GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS)`` must be used instead.

There are two main signatures for create_javah.  The first signature
returns generated files through variable specified by GENERATED_FILES option:

::

 Example:
 Create_javah(GENERATED_FILES files_headers
   CLASSES org.cmake.HelloWorld
   CLASSPATH hello.jar
 )

The second signature for create_javah creates a target which encapsulates
header files generation.

::

 Example:
 Create_javah(TARGET target_headers
   CLASSES org.cmake.HelloWorld
   CLASSPATH hello.jar
 )

Both signatures share same options.

 ``CLASSES <class>...``
   Specifies Java classes used to generate headers.

 ``CLASSPATH <classpath>...``
   Specifies various paths to look up classes. Here .class files, jar files or targets
   created by command add_jar can be used.

 ``DEPENDS <depend>...``
   Targets on which the javah target depends

 ``OUTPUT_NAME <path>``
   Concatenates the resulting header files for all the classes listed by option CLASSES
   into <path>. Same behavior as option '-o' of javah tool.

 ``OUTPUT_DIR <path>``
   Sets the directory where the header files will be generated. Same behavior as option
   '-d' of javah tool. If not specified, ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} is used as output directory.

UseJavaSymlinks

Helper script for UseJava.cmake

UseSWIG
-------

This file provides support for ``SWIG``. It is assumed that ``FindSWIG``
module has already been loaded.

Defines the following command for use with ``SWIG``:

.. command:: swig_add_library

  Define swig module with given name and specified language::

   swig_add_library(<name>
                    [TYPE <SHARED|MODULE|STATIC|USE_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS>]
                    LANGUAGE <language>
                    [NO_PROXY]
                    [OUTPUT_DIR <directory>]
                    [OUTFILE_DIR <directory>]
                    SOURCES <file>...
                   )

 Targets created with the ``swig_add_library`` command have the same
 capabilities as targets created with the :command:`add_library` command, so
 those targets can be used with any command expecting a target (e.g.
 :command:`target_link_libraries`).

 .. note::

   This command creates a target with the specified ``<name>`` when
   policy :policy:`CMP0078` is set to ``NEW``.  Otherwise, the legacy
   behavior will choose a different target name and store it in the
   ``SWIG_MODULE_<name>_REAL_NAME`` variable.

 .. note::

   For multi-config generators, this module does not support
   configuration-specific files generated by ``SWIG``. All build
   configurations must result in the same generated source file.

 ``TYPE``
   ``SHARED``, ``MODULE`` and ``STATIC`` have the same semantic as for the
   :command:`add_library` command. If ``USE_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` is specified,
   the library type will be ``STATIC`` or ``SHARED`` based on whether the
   current value of the :variable:`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` variable is ``ON``. If
   no type is specified, ``MODULE`` will be used.

 ``LANGUAGE``
   Specify the target language.

 ``NO_PROXY``
   Prevent the generation of the wrapper layer (swig ``-noproxy`` option).

 ``OUTPUT_DIR``
   Specify where to write the language specific files (swig ``-outdir``
   option). If not given, the ``CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR`` variable will be used.
   If neither is specified, the default depends on the value of the
   ``UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION`` variable as follows:

   * If ``UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION`` is 1 or is undefined, output is written to
     the :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` directory.
   * If ``UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION`` is 2, a dedicated directory will be used.
     The path of this directory can be retrieved from the
     ``SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES_DIRECTORY`` target property.

 ``OUTFILE_DIR``
   Specify an output directory name where the generated source file will be
   placed (swig -o option). If not specified, the ``SWIG_OUTFILE_DIR`` variable
   will be used. If neither is specified, ``OUTPUT_DIR`` or
   ``CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR`` is used instead.

 ``SOURCES``
   List of sources for the library. Files with extension ``.i`` will be
   identified as sources for the ``SWIG`` tool. Other files will be handled in
   the standard way. This behavior can be overriden by specifying the variable
   ``SWIG_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS``.

 .. note::

   If ``UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION`` is set to 2, it is **strongly** recommended
   to use a dedicated directory unique to the target when either the
   ``OUTPUT_DIR`` option or the ``CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR`` variable are specified.
   The output directory contents are erased as part of the target build, so
   to prevent interference between targets or losing other important files,
   each target should have its own dedicated output directory.

.. command:: swig_link_libraries

  Link libraries to swig module::

   swig_link_libraries(<name> <item>...)

 This command has same capabilities as :command:`target_link_libraries`
 command.

 .. note::

   If variable ``UseSWIG_TARGET_NAME_PREFERENCE`` is set to ``STANDARD``, this
   command is deprecated and :command:`target_link_libraries` command must be
   used instead.

Source file properties on module files **must** be set before the invocation
of the ``swig_add_library`` command to specify special behavior of SWIG and
ensure generated files will receive the required settings.

``CPLUSPLUS``
  Call SWIG in c++ mode.  For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set_property(SOURCE mymod.i PROPERTY CPLUSPLUS ON)
    swig_add_library(mymod LANGUAGE python SOURCES mymod.i)

``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and ``COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  Add custom flags to SWIG compiler and have same semantic as properties
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and
  ``COMPILE_OPTIONS``.

``USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
  If set to ``TRUE``, contents of target property
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` will be forwarded to ``SWIG`` compiler.
  If set to ``FALSE`` target property ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` will be
  ignored. If not set, target property ``SWIG_USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
  will be considered.

``GENERATED_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``GENERATED_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and ``GENERATED_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  Add custom flags to the C/C++ generated source. They will fill, respectively,
  properties ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and
  ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` of generated C/C++ file.

``DEPENDS``
  Specify additional dependencies to the source file.

``SWIG_MODULE_NAME``
  Specify the actual import name of the module in the target language.
  This is required if it cannot be scanned automatically from source
  or different from the module file basename.  For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set_property(SOURCE mymod.i PROPERTY SWIG_MODULE_NAME mymod_realname)

  .. note::

 If policy :policy:`CMP0086` is set to ``NEW``, ``-module <module_name>``
 is passed to ``SWIG`` compiler.

Target library properties can be set to apply same configuration to all SWIG
input files.

``SWIG_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``SWIG_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and ``SWIG_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  These properties will be applied to all SWIG input files and have same
  semantic as target properties ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``,
  ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and ``COMPILE_OPTIONS``.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set (UseSWIG_TARGET_NAME_PREFERENCE STANDARD)
    swig_add_library(mymod LANGUAGE python SOURCES mymod.i)
    set_property(TARGET mymod PROPERTY SWIG_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS MY_DEF1 MY_DEF2)
    set_property(TARGET mymod PROPERTY SWIG_COMPILE_OPTIONS -bla -blb)

``SWIG_USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
  If set to ``TRUE``, contents of target property
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` will be forwarded to ``SWIG`` compiler.
  If set to ``FALSE`` or not defined, target property
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` will be ignored. This behavior can be
  overridden by specifying source property ``USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``.

``SWIG_GENERATED_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``SWIG_GENERATED_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and ``SWIG_GENERATED_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  These properties will populate, respectively, properties
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and
  ``COMPILE_FLAGS`` of all generated C/C++ files.

``SWIG_DEPENDS``
  Add dependencies to all SWIG input files.

The following target properties are output properties and can be used to get
information about support files generated by ``SWIG`` interface compilation.

``SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES``
  This output property list of wrapper files generated during SWIG compilation.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set (UseSWIG_TARGET_NAME_PREFERENCE STANDARD)
    swig_add_library(mymod LANGUAGE python SOURCES mymod.i)
    get_property(support_files TARGET mymod PROPERTY SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES)

  .. note::

 Only most principal support files are listed. In case some advanced
 features of ``SWIG`` are used (for example ``%template``), associated
 support files may not be listed. Prefer to use the
 ``SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES_DIRECTORY`` property to handle support files.

``SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES_DIRECTORY``
  This output property specifies the directory where support files will be
  generated.

Some variables can be set to customize the behavior of ``swig_add_library``
as well as ``SWIG``:

``UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION``
  Specify different behaviors for ``UseSWIG`` module.

  * Set to 1 or undefined: Legacy behavior is applied.
  * Set to 2: A new strategy is applied regarding support files: the output
    directory of support files is erased before ``SWIG`` interface compilation.

``CMAKE_SWIG_FLAGS``
  Add flags to all swig calls.

``CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR``
  Specify where to write the language specific files (swig ``-outdir`` option).

``SWIG_OUTFILE_DIR``
  Specify an output directory name where the generated source file will be
  placed.  If not specified, ``CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR`` is used.

``SWIG_MODULE_<name>_EXTRA_DEPS``
  Specify extra dependencies for the generated module for ``<name>``.

``SWIG_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS``
  Specify a list of source file extensions to override the default
  behavior of considering only ``.i`` files as sources for the ``SWIG``
  tool. For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set(SWIG_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS ".i" ".swg")

UsewxWidgets
------------

Convenience include for using wxWidgets library.

Determines if wxWidgets was FOUND and sets the appropriate libs,
incdirs, flags, etc.  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and LINK_DIRECTORIES are
called.

USAGE

::

 # Note that for MinGW users the order of libs is important!
 find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED net gl core base)
 include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
 # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
 target_link_libraries(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})

DEPRECATED

::

 LINK_LIBRARIES is not called in favor of adding dependencies per target.

WriteCompilerDetectionHeader
----------------------------

This module provides the function write_compiler_detection_header().

This function can be used to generate a file suitable for preprocessor
inclusion which contains macros to be used in source code::

 write_compiler_detection_header(
           FILE <file>
           PREFIX <prefix>
           [OUTPUT_FILES_VAR <output_files_var> OUTPUT_DIR <output_dir>]
           COMPILERS <compiler> [...]
           FEATURES <feature> [...]
           [BARE_FEATURES <feature> [...]]
           [VERSION <version>]
           [PROLOG <prolog>]
           [EPILOG <epilog>]
           [ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILERS]
           [ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILER_VERSIONS]
 )

This generates the file ``<file>`` with macros which all have the prefix
``<prefix>``.

By default, all content is written directly to the ``<file>``.  The
``OUTPUT_FILES_VAR`` may be specified to cause the compiler-specific
content to be written to separate files.  The separate files are then
available in the ``<output_files_var>`` and may be consumed by the caller
for installation for example.  The ``OUTPUT_DIR`` specifies a relative
path from the main ``<file>`` to the compiler-specific files. For example:

 write_compiler_detection_header(
   FILE climbingstats_compiler_detection.h
   PREFIX ClimbingStats
   OUTPUT_FILES_VAR support_files
   OUTPUT_DIR compilers
   COMPILERS GNU Clang MSVC Intel
   FEATURES cxx_variadic_templates
 )
 install(FILES
   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/climbingstats_compiler_detection.h
   DESTINATION include
 )
 install(FILES
   ${support_files}
   DESTINATION include/compilers
 )

``VERSION`` may be used to specify the API version to be generated.
Future versions of CMake may introduce alternative APIs.  A given
API is selected by any ``<version>`` value greater than or equal
to the version of CMake that introduced the given API and less
than the version of CMake that introduced its succeeding API.
The value of the ``CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION``
variable is used if no explicit version is specified.
(As of CMake version 3.14.4 there is only one API version.)

``PROLOG`` may be specified as text content to write at the start of the
header. ``EPILOG`` may be specified as text content to write at the end
of the header

At least one ``<compiler>`` and one ``<feature>`` must be listed.  Compilers
which are known to CMake, but not specified are detected and a preprocessor
``#error`` is generated for them.  A preprocessor macro matching
``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_IS_<compiler>`` is generated for each compiler
known to CMake to contain the value ``0`` or ``1``.

Possible compiler identifiers are documented with the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable.
Available features in this version of CMake are listed in the
``CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES`` and
``CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES`` global properties.
The ``{c,cxx}_std_*`` meta-features are ignored if requested.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features.

``BARE_FEATURES`` will define the compatibility macros with the name used in
newer versions of the language standard, so the code can use the new feature
name unconditionally.

``ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILERS`` and ``ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILER_VERSIONS`` cause
the module to generate conditions that treat unknown compilers as simply
lacking all features.  Without these options the default behavior is to
generate a ``#error`` for unknown compilers and versions.

Feature Test Macros
===================

For each compiler, a preprocessor macro is generated matching
``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_IS_<compiler>`` which has the content either ``0``
or ``1``, depending on the compiler in use. Preprocessor macros for
compiler version components are generated matching
``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_VERSION_MAJOR`` ``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_VERSION_MINOR``
and ``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_VERSION_PATCH`` containing decimal values
for the corresponding compiler version components, if defined.

A preprocessor test is generated based on the compiler version
denoting whether each feature is enabled.  A preprocessor macro
matching ``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_<FEATURE>``, where ``<FEATURE>`` is the
upper-case ``<feature>`` name, is generated to contain the value
``0`` or ``1`` depending on whether the compiler in use supports the
feature:

 write_compiler_detection_header(
   FILE climbingstats_compiler_detection.h
   PREFIX ClimbingStats
   COMPILERS GNU Clang AppleClang MSVC Intel
   FEATURES cxx_variadic_templates
 )

 #if ClimbingStats_COMPILER_CXX_VARIADIC_TEMPLATES
 template<typename... T>
 void someInterface(T t...) { /* ... */ }
 #else
 // Compatibility versions
 template<typename T1>
 void someInterface(T1 t1) { /* ... */ }
 template<typename T1, typename T2>
 void someInterface(T1 t1, T2 t2) { /* ... */ }
 template<typename T1, typename T2, typename T3>
 void someInterface(T1 t1, T2 t2, T3 t3) { /* ... */ }
 #endif

Symbol Macros
=============

Some additional symbol-defines are created for particular features for
use as symbols which may be conditionally defined empty:

 class MyClass ClimbingStats_FINAL
 {
     ClimbingStats_CONSTEXPR int someInterface() { return 42; }
 };

The ``ClimbingStats_FINAL`` macro will expand to ``final`` if the
compiler (and its flags) support the ``cxx_final`` feature, and the
``ClimbingStats_CONSTEXPR`` macro will expand to ``constexpr``
if ``cxx_constexpr`` is supported.

If ``BARE_FEATURES cxx_final`` was given as argument the ``final`` keyword
will be defined for old compilers, too.

The following features generate corresponding symbol defines and if they
are available as ``BARE_FEATURES``:

========================== =================================== ================= ======
        Feature                          Define                      Symbol       bare
========================== =================================== ================= ======
``c_restrict``              ``<PREFIX>_RESTRICT``               ``restrict``      yes
``cxx_constexpr``           ``<PREFIX>_CONSTEXPR``              ``constexpr``     yes
``cxx_deleted_functions``   ``<PREFIX>_DELETED_FUNCTION``       ``= delete``
``cxx_extern_templates``    ``<PREFIX>_EXTERN_TEMPLATE``        ``extern``
``cxx_final``               ``<PREFIX>_FINAL``                  ``final``         yes
``cxx_noexcept``            ``<PREFIX>_NOEXCEPT``               ``noexcept``      yes
``cxx_noexcept``            ``<PREFIX>_NOEXCEPT_EXPR(X)``       ``noexcept(X)``
``cxx_override``            ``<PREFIX>_OVERRIDE``               ``override``      yes
========================== =================================== ================= ======

Compatibility Implementation Macros
===================================

Some features are suitable for wrapping in a macro with a backward
compatibility implementation if the compiler does not support the feature.

When the ``cxx_static_assert`` feature is not provided by the compiler,
a compatibility implementation is available via the
``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT(COND)`` and
``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT_MSG(COND, MSG)`` function-like macros. The macros
expand to ``static_assert`` where that compiler feature is available, and
to a compatibility implementation otherwise. In the first form, the
condition is stringified in the message field of ``static_assert``.  In
the second form, the message ``MSG`` is passed to the message field of
``static_assert``, or ignored if using the backward compatibility
implementation.

The ``cxx_attribute_deprecated`` feature provides a macro definition
``<PREFIX>_DEPRECATED``, which expands to either the standard
``[[deprecated]]`` attribute or a compiler-specific decorator such
as ``__attribute__((__deprecated__))`` used by GNU compilers.

The ``cxx_alignas`` feature provides a macro definition
``<PREFIX>_ALIGNAS`` which expands to either the standard ``alignas``
decorator or a compiler-specific decorator such as
``__attribute__ ((__aligned__))`` used by GNU compilers.

The ``cxx_alignof`` feature provides a macro definition
``<PREFIX>_ALIGNOF`` which expands to either the standard ``alignof``
decorator or a compiler-specific decorator such as ``__alignof__``
used by GNU compilers.

============================= ================================ ===================== ======
          Feature                          Define                     Symbol          bare
============================= ================================ ===================== ======
``cxx_alignas``                ``<PREFIX>_ALIGNAS``             ``alignas``
``cxx_alignof``                ``<PREFIX>_ALIGNOF``             ``alignof``
``cxx_nullptr``                ``<PREFIX>_NULLPTR``             ``nullptr``           yes
``cxx_static_assert``          ``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT``       ``static_assert``
``cxx_static_assert``          ``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT_MSG``   ``static_assert``
``cxx_attribute_deprecated``   ``<PREFIX>_DEPRECATED``          ``[[deprecated]]``
``cxx_attribute_deprecated``   ``<PREFIX>_DEPRECATED_MSG``      ``[[deprecated]]``
``cxx_thread_local``           ``<PREFIX>_THREAD_LOCAL``        ``thread_local``
============================= ================================ ===================== ======

A use-case which arises with such deprecation macros is the deprecation
of an entire library.  In that case, all public API in the library may
be decorated with the ``<PREFIX>_DEPRECATED`` macro.  This results in
very noisy build output when building the library itself, so the macro
may be may be defined to empty in that case when building the deprecated
library:

 add_library(compat_support ${srcs})
 target_compile_definitions(compat_support
   PRIVATE
     CompatSupport_DEPRECATED=
 )

-----------

Locate AVIFILE library and include paths

AVIFILE (http://avifile.sourceforge.net/)is a set of libraries for
i386 machines to use various AVI codecs.  Support is limited beyond
Linux.  Windows provides native AVI support, and so doesn't need this
library.  This module defines

::

 AVIFILE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find avifile.h , etc.
 AVIFILE_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against
 AVIFILE_DEFINITIONS, definitions to use when compiling
 AVIFILE_FOUND, If false, don't try to use AVIFILE

FindBISON
---------

Find ``bison`` executable and provide a macro to generate custom build rules.

The module defines the following variables:

``BISON_EXECUTABLE``
  path to the ``bison`` program

``BISON_VERSION``
  version of ``bison``

``BISON_FOUND``
  true if the program was found

The minimum required version of ``bison`` can be specified using the
standard CMake syntax, e.g.  ``find_package(BISON 2.1.3)``.

If ``bison`` is found, the module defines the macro::

 BISON_TARGET(<Name> <YaccInput> <CodeOutput>
              [COMPILE_FLAGS <flags>]
              [DEFINES_FILE <file>]
              [VERBOSE [<file>]]
              [REPORT_FILE <file>]
              )

which will create a custom rule to generate a parser.  ``<YaccInput>`` is
the path to a yacc file.  ``<CodeOutput>`` is the name of the source file
generated by bison.  A header file is also be generated, and contains
the token list.

The options are:

``COMPILE_FLAGS <flags>``
  Specify flags to be added to the ``bison`` command line.

``DEFINES_FILE <file>``
  Specify a non-default header ``<file>`` to be generated by ``bison``.

``VERBOSE [<file>]``
  Tell ``bison`` to write a report file of the grammar and parser.
  If ``<file>`` is given, it specifies path the report file is copied to.
  ``[<file>]`` is left for backward compatibility of this module.
  Use ``VERBOSE REPORT_FILE <file>``.

``REPORT_FILE <file>``
  Specify a non-default report ``<file>``, if generated.

The macro defines the following variables:

``BISON_<Name>_DEFINED``
  true is the macro ran successfully

``BISON_<Name>_INPUT``
  The input source file, an alias for <YaccInput>

``BISON_<Name>_OUTPUT_SOURCE``
  The source file generated by bison

``BISON_<Name>_OUTPUT_HEADER``
  The header file generated by bison

``BISON_<Name>_OUTPUTS``
  All files generated by bison including the source, the header and the report

``BISON_<Name>_COMPILE_FLAGS``
  Options used in the ``bison`` command line

Example usage:

 find_package(BISON)
 BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp
              DEFINES_FILE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.h)
 add_executable(Foo main.cpp ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS})

FindBLAS
--------

Find BLAS library

This module finds an installed fortran library that implements the
BLAS linear-algebra interface (see http://www.netlib.org/blas/).  The
list of libraries searched for is taken from the autoconf macro file,
acx_blas.m4 (distributed at
http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/ac-archive/acx_blas.html).

    set(BLA_VENDOR Intel10_64lp)
    find_package(BLAS)

FindBacktrace
-------------

Find provider for backtrace(3).

Checks if OS supports backtrace(3) via either libc or custom library.
This module defines the following variables:

``Backtrace_HEADER``
  The header file needed for backtrace(3). Cached.
  Could be forcibly set by user.
``Backtrace_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  The include directories needed to use backtrace(3) header.
``Backtrace_LIBRARIES``
  The libraries (linker flags) needed to use backtrace(3), if any.
``Backtrace_FOUND``
  Is set if and only if backtrace(3) support detected.

The following cache variables are also available to set or use:

``Backtrace_LIBRARY``
  The external library providing backtrace, if any.
``Backtrace_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The directory holding the backtrace(3) header.

Typical usage is to generate of header file using configure_file() with the
contents like the following::

 #cmakedefine01 Backtrace_FOUND
 #if Backtrace_FOUND
 # include <${Backtrace_HEADER}>
 #endif

And then reference that generated header file in actual source.

FindBoost
---------

Find Boost include dirs and libraries

Use this module by invoking find_package with the form::

 find_package(Boost
   [version] [EXACT]      # Minimum or EXACT version e.g. 1.67.0
   [REQUIRED]             # Fail with error if Boost is not found
   [COMPONENTS <libs>...] # Boost libraries by their canonical name
                          # e.g. "date_time" for "libboost_date_time"
   [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS <libs>...]
                          # Optional Boost libraries by their canonical name)
   )                      # e.g. "date_time" for "libboost_date_time"

This module finds headers and requested component libraries OR a CMake
package configuration file provided by a "Boost CMake" build.  For the
latter case skip to the "Boost CMake" section below.  For the former
case results are reported in variables::

 Boost_FOUND            - True if headers and requested libraries were found
 Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS     - Boost include directories
 Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS     - Link directories for Boost libraries
 Boost_LIBRARIES        - Boost component libraries to be linked
 Boost_<C>_FOUND        - True if component <C> was found (<C> is upper-case)
 Boost_<C>_LIBRARY      - Libraries to link for component <C> (may include
                          target_link_libraries debug/optimized keywords)
 Boost_VERSION          - BOOST_VERSION value from boost/version.hpp
 Boost_LIB_VERSION      - Version string appended to library filenames
 Boost_MAJOR_VERSION    - Boost major version number (X in X.y.z)
 Boost_MINOR_VERSION    - Boost minor version number (Y in x.Y.z)
 Boost_SUBMINOR_VERSION - Boost subminor version number (Z in x.y.Z)
 Boost_VERSION_STRING   - Boost version number in x.y.z format
 Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS (Windows)
                        - Pass to add_definitions() to have diagnostic
                          information about Boost's automatic linking
                          displayed during compilation

Note that Boost Python components require a Python version suffix
(Boost 1.67 and later), e.g. ``python36`` or ``python27`` for the
versions built against Python 3.6 and 2.7, respectively.  This also
applies to additional components using Python including
``mpi_python`` and ``numpy``.  Earlier Boost releases may use
distribution-specific suffixes such as ``2``, ``3`` or ``2.7``.
These may also be used as suffixes, but note that they are not
portable.

This module reads hints about search locations from variables::

 BOOST_ROOT             - Preferred installation prefix
  (or BOOSTROOT)
 BOOST_INCLUDEDIR       - Preferred include directory e.g. <prefix>/include
 BOOST_LIBRARYDIR       - Preferred library directory e.g. <prefix>/lib
 Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS  - Set to ON to disable searching in locations not
                          specified by these hint variables. Default is OFF.
 Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
                        - List of Boost versions not known to this module
                          (Boost install locations may contain the version)

and saves search results persistently in CMake cache entries::

 Boost_INCLUDE_DIR         - Directory containing Boost headers
 Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE - Directory containing release Boost libraries
 Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG   - Directory containing debug Boost libraries
 Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_DEBUG   - Component <C> library debug variant
 Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_RELEASE - Component <C> library release variant

The following ``IMPORTED`` targets are also defined::

 Boost::boost                  - Target for header-only dependencies
                                 (Boost include directory)
 Boost::<C>                    - Target for specific component dependency
                                 (shared or static library); <C> is lower-
                                 case
 Boost::diagnostic_definitions - interface target to enable diagnostic
                                 information about Boost's automatic linking
                                 during compilation (adds BOOST_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC)
 Boost::disable_autolinking    - interface target to disable automatic
                                 linking with MSVC (adds BOOST_ALL_NO_LIB)
 Boost::dynamic_linking        - interface target to enable dynamic linking
                                 linking with MSVC (adds BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK)

Implicit dependencies such as Boost::filesystem requiring
Boost::system will be automatically detected and satisfied, even
if system is not specified when using find_package and if
Boost::system is not added to target_link_libraries.  If using
Boost::thread, then Threads::Threads will also be added automatically.

It is important to note that the imported targets behave differently
than variables created by this module: multiple calls to
find_package(Boost) in the same directory or sub-directories with
different options (e.g. static or shared) will not override the
values of the targets created by the first call.

Users may set these hints or results as cache entries.  Projects
should not read these entries directly but instead use the above
result variables.  Note that some hint names start in upper-case
"BOOST".  One may specify these as environment variables if they are
not specified as CMake variables or cache entries.

This module first searches for the Boost header files using the above
hint variables (excluding BOOST_LIBRARYDIR) and saves the result in
Boost_INCLUDE_DIR.  Then it searches for requested component libraries
using the above hints (excluding BOOST_INCLUDEDIR and
Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS), "lib" directories near Boost_INCLUDE_DIR,
and the library name configuration settings below.  It saves the
library directories in Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG and
Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE and individual library
locations in Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_DEBUG and Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_RELEASE.
When one changes settings used by previous searches in the same build
tree (excluding environment variables) this module discards previous
search results affected by the changes and searches again.

Boost libraries come in many variants encoded in their file name.
Users or projects may tell this module which variant to find by
setting variables::

 Boost_USE_DEBUG_LIBS     - Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to search
                            and use the debug libraries.  Default is ON.
 Boost_USE_RELEASE_LIBS   - Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to search
                            and use the release libraries.  Default is ON.
 Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED  - Set to OFF to use the non-multithreaded
                            libraries ('mt' tag).  Default is ON.
 Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS    - Set to ON to force the use of the static
                            libraries.  Default is OFF.
 Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME - Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to use
                            libraries linked statically to the C++ runtime
                            ('s' tag).  Default is platform dependent.
 Boost_USE_DEBUG_RUNTIME  - Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to use
                            libraries linked to the MS debug C++ runtime
                            ('g' tag).  Default is ON.
 Boost_USE_DEBUG_PYTHON   - Set to ON to use libraries compiled with a
                            debug Python build ('y' tag). Default is OFF.
 Boost_USE_STLPORT        - Set to ON to use libraries compiled with
                            STLPort ('p' tag).  Default is OFF.
 Boost_USE_STLPORT_DEPRECATED_NATIVE_IOSTREAMS
                          - Set to ON to use libraries compiled with
                            STLPort deprecated "native iostreams"
                            ('n' tag).  Default is OFF.
 Boost_COMPILER           - Set to the compiler-specific library suffix
                            (e.g. "-gcc43").  Default is auto-computed
                            for the C++ compiler in use.  A list may be
                            used if multiple compatible suffixes should
                            be tested for, in decreasing order of
                            preference.
 Boost_ARCHITECTURE       - Set to the architecture-specific library suffix
                            (e.g. "-x64").  Default is auto-computed for the
                            C++ compiler in use.
 Boost_THREADAPI          - Suffix for "thread" component library name,
                            such as "pthread" or "win32".  Names with
                            and without this suffix will both be tried.
 Boost_NAMESPACE          - Alternate namespace used to build boost with
                            e.g. if set to "myboost", will search for
                            myboost_thread instead of boost_thread.

Other variables one may set to control this module are::

 Boost_DEBUG              - Set to ON to enable debug output from FindBoost.
                            Please enable this before filing any bug report.
 Boost_DETAILED_FAILURE_MSG
                          - Set to ON to add detailed information to the
                            failure message even when the REQUIRED option
                            is not given to the find_package call.
 Boost_REALPATH           - Set to ON to resolve symlinks for discovered
                            libraries to assist with packaging.  For example,
                            the "system" component library may be resolved to
                            "/usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.67.0" instead of
                            "/usr/lib/libboost_system.so".  This does not
                            affect linking and should not be enabled unless
                            the user needs this information.
 Boost_LIBRARY_DIR        - Default value for Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE and
                            Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG.

On Visual Studio and Borland compilers Boost headers request automatic
linking to corresponding libraries.  This requires matching libraries
to be linked explicitly or available in the link library search path.
In this case setting Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to OFF may not achieve
dynamic linking.  Boost automatic linking typically requests static
libraries with a few exceptions (such as Boost.Python).  Use::

 add_definitions(${Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS})

to ask Boost to report information about automatic linking requests.

Example to find Boost headers only::

 find_package(Boost 1.36.0)
 if(Boost_FOUND)
   include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   add_executable(foo foo.cc)
 endif()

Example to find Boost libraries and use imported targets::

 find_package(Boost 1.56 REQUIRED COMPONENTS
              date_time filesystem iostreams)
 add_executable(foo foo.cc)
 target_link_libraries(foo Boost::date_time Boost::filesystem
                           Boost::iostreams)

Example to find Boost Python 3.6 libraries and use imported targets::

 find_package(Boost 1.67 REQUIRED COMPONENTS
              python36 numpy36)
 add_executable(foo foo.cc)
 target_link_libraries(foo Boost::python36 Boost::numpy36)

Example to find Boost headers and some *static* (release only) libraries::

 set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS        ON)  # only find static libs
 set(Boost_USE_DEBUG_LIBS         OFF) # ignore debug libs and
 set(Boost_USE_RELEASE_LIBS       ON)  # only find release libs
 set(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED      ON)
 set(Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME    OFF)
 find_package(Boost 1.66.0 COMPONENTS date_time filesystem system ...)
 if(Boost_FOUND)
   include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   add_executable(foo foo.cc)
   target_link_libraries(foo ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
 endif()

Boost CMake
^^^^^^^^^^^

If Boost was built using the boost-cmake project it provides a package
configuration file for use with find_package's Config mode.  This
module looks for the package configuration file called
BoostConfig.cmake or boost-config.cmake and stores the result in cache
entry "Boost_DIR".  If found, the package configuration file is loaded
and this module returns with no further action.  See documentation of
the Boost CMake package configuration for details on what it provides.

Set Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE to ON to disable the search for boost-cmake.

::

 #=============
 Example foo_test.h:

::

 #include <cxxtest/TestSuite.h>

::

 class MyTestSuite : public CxxTest::TestSuite
 {
 public:
    void testAddition( void )
    {
       TS_ASSERT( 1 + 1 > 1 );
       TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( 1 + 1, 2 );
    }
 };

FindCygwin
----------

this module looks for Cygwin

FindDart
--------

Find DART

This module looks for the dart testing software and sets DART_ROOT to
point to where it found it.

FindDCMTK
---------

Find DCMTK libraries and applications

The module defines the following variables::

 DCMTK_INCLUDE_DIRS  - Directories to include to use DCMTK
 DCMTK_LIBRARIES     - Files to link against to use DCMTK
 DCMTK_FOUND         - If false, don't try to use DCMTK
 DCMTK_DIR           - (optional) Source directory for DCMTK

Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module is able to find a version of DCMTK that does or does not export
a *DCMTKConfig.cmake* file. It applies a two step process:

* Step 1:  Attempt to find DCMTK version providing a *DCMTKConfig.cmake* file.
* Step 2:  If step 1 failed, rely on *FindDCMTK.cmake* to set `DCMTK_*` variables details below.


`Recent DCMTK
<http://git.dcmtk.org/web?p=dcmtk.git;a=commit;h=662ae187c493c6b9a73dd5e3875372cebd0c11fe>`_
provides a *DCMTKConfig.cmake* :manual:`package configuration file
<cmake-packages(7)>`. To exclusively use the package configuration file
(recommended when possible), pass the `NO_MODULE` option to
``find_package()``. For example, `find_package(DCMTK NO_MODULE)`.
This requires official DCMTK snapshot *3.6.1_20140617* or newer.


Until all clients update to the more recent DCMTK, build systems will need
to support different versions of DCMTK.

On any given system, the following combinations of DCMTK versions could be
considered:

+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
|        |   SYSTEM DCMTK      |      LOCAL DCMTK      |     Supported ?   |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case A |   NA                |      [ ] DCMTKConfig  |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case B |   NA                |      [X] DCMTKConfig  |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case C |   [ ] DCMTKConfig   |      NA               |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case D |   [X] DCMTKConfig   |      NA               |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case E |   [ ] DCMTKConfig   |      [ ] DCMTKConfig  |         YES (*)   |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case F |   [X] DCMTKConfig   |      [ ] DCMTKConfig  |         NO        |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case G |   [ ] DCMTKConfig   |      [X] DCMTKConfig  |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case H |   [X] DCMTKConfig   |      [X] DCMTKConfig  |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+

 (*) See Troubleshooting section.

Legend:

  NA ...............: Means that no System or Local DCMTK is available

  [ ] DCMTKConfig ..: Means that the version of DCMTK does NOT export a DCMTKConfig.cmake file.

  [X] DCMTKConfig ..: Means that the version of DCMTK exports a DCMTKConfig.cmake file.


Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What to do if my project finds a different version of DCMTK?

Remove DCMTK entry from the CMake cache per ``find_package()``
documentation.

FindDevIL
---------



This module locates the developer's image library.
http://openil.sourceforge.net/

This module sets:

::

 IL_LIBRARIES -   the name of the IL library. These include the full path to
                  the core DevIL library. This one has to be linked into the
                  application.
 ILU_LIBRARIES -  the name of the ILU library. Again, the full path. This
                  library is for filters and effects, not actual loading. It
                  doesn't have to be linked if the functionality it provides
                  is not used.
 ILUT_LIBRARIES - the name of the ILUT library. Full path. This part of the
                  library interfaces with OpenGL. It is not strictly needed
                  in applications.
 IL_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find the il.h, ilu.h and ilut.h files.
 DevIL_FOUND    - this is set to TRUE if all the above variables were set.
                  This will be set to false if ILU or ILUT are not found,
                  even if they are not needed. In most systems, if one
                  library is found all the others are as well. That's the
                  way the DevIL developers release it.

FindDoxygen
-----------

Doxygen is a documentation generation tool (see http://www.doxygen.org).
This module looks for Doxygen and some optional tools it supports. These
tools are enabled as components in the ``find_package()`` command:

``dot``
  Graphviz ``dot`` utility used to render various
  graphs.
``mscgen``
  Message Chart Generator utility used
  by Doxygen's ``\msc`` and ``\mscfile`` commands.
``dia``
  Dia the diagram editor used by Doxygen's
  ``\diafile`` command.

Examples:

 # Require dot, treat the other components as optional
 find_package(Doxygen
              REQUIRED dot
              OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS mscgen dia)

The following variables are defined by this module:

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_FOUND

  True if the ``doxygen`` executable was found.

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_VERSION

  The version reported by ``doxygen --version``.

The module defines ``IMPORTED`` targets for Doxygen and each component found.
These can be used as part of custom commands, etc. and should be preferred over
old-style (and now deprecated) variables like ``DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE``. The
following import targets are defined if their corresponding executable could be
found (the component import targets will only be defined if that component was
requested):

::

 Doxygen::doxygen
 Doxygen::dot
 Doxygen::mscgen
 Doxygen::dia

Functions
^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: doxygen_add_docs

  This function is intended as a convenience for adding a target for generating
  documentation with Doxygen. It aims to provide sensible defaults so that
  projects can generally just provide the input files and directories and that
  will be sufficient to give sensible results. The function supports the
  ability to customize the Doxygen configuration used to build the
  documentation.

   doxygen_add_docs(targetName
       [filesOrDirs...]
       [ALL]
       [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
       [COMMENT comment])

 The function constructs a ``Doxyfile`` and defines a custom target that runs
 Doxygen on that generated file. The listed files and directories are used as
 the ``INPUT`` of the generated ``Doxyfile`` and they can contain wildcards.
 Any files that are listed explicitly will also be added as ``SOURCES`` of the
 custom target so they will show up in an IDE project's source list.

 So that relative input paths work as expected, by default the working
 directory of the Doxygen command will be the current source directory (i.e.
 :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`). This can be overridden with the
 ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` option to change the directory used as the relative
 base point. Note also that Doxygen's default behavior is to strip the working
 directory from relative paths in the generated documentation (see the
 ``STRIP_FROM_PATH`` `Doxygen config option
 <http://www.doxygen.org/manual/config.html>`_ for details).

 If provided, the optional ``comment`` will be passed as the ``COMMENT`` for
 the :command:`add_custom_target` command used to create the custom target
 internally.

 If ALL is set, the target will be added to the default build target.

 The contents of the generated ``Doxyfile`` can be customized by setting CMake
 variables before calling ``doxygen_add_docs()``. Any variable with a name of
 the form ``DOXYGEN_<tag>`` will have its value substituted for the
 corresponding ``<tag>`` configuration option in the ``Doxyfile``. See the
 `Doxygen documentation <http://www.doxygen.org/manual/config.html>`_ for the
 full list of supported configuration options.

 Some of Doxygen's defaults are overridden to provide more appropriate
 behavior for a CMake project. Each of the following will be explicitly set
 unless the variable already has a value before ``doxygen_add_docs()`` is
 called (with some exceptions noted):

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT

   Set to ``YES`` if the ``dot`` component was requested and it was found,
   ``NO`` otherwise. Any existing value of ``DOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT`` is ignored.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_DOT_MULTI_TARGETS

   Set to ``YES`` by this module (note that this requires a ``dot`` version
   newer than 1.8.10). This option is only meaningful if ``DOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT``
   is also set to ``YES``.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_GENERATE_LATEX

   Set to ``NO`` by this module.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_WARN_FORMAT

   For Visual Studio based generators, this is set to the form recognized by
   the Visual Studio IDE: ``$file($line) : $text``. For all other generators,
   Doxygen's default value is not overridden.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_PROJECT_NAME

   Populated with the name of the current project (i.e.
   :variable:`PROJECT_NAME`).

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_PROJECT_NUMBER

   Populated with the version of the current project (i.e.
   :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION`).

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_PROJECT_BRIEF

   Populated with the description of the current project (i.e.
   :variable:`PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`).

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_INPUT

   Projects should not set this variable. It will be populated with the set of
   files and directories passed to ``doxygen_add_docs()``, thereby providing
   consistent behavior with the other built-in commands like
   :command:`add_executable`, :command:`add_library` and
   :command:`add_custom_target`. If a variable named ``DOXYGEN_INPUT`` is set
   by the project, it will be ignored and a warning will be issued.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_RECURSIVE

   Set to ``YES`` by this module.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS

   If the set of inputs includes directories, this variable will specify
   patterns used to exclude files from them. The following patterns are added
   by ``doxygen_add_docs()`` to ensure CMake-specific files and directories
   are not included in the input. If the project sets
   ``DOXYGEN_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS``, those contents are merged with these
   additional patterns rather than replacing them:

   ::

     */.git/*
     */.svn/*
     */.hg/*
     */CMakeFiles/*
     */_CPack_Packages/*
     DartConfiguration.tcl
     CMakeLists.txt
     CMakeCache.txt

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

   Set to :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` by this module. Note that if
   the project provides its own value for this and it is a relative path, it
   will be converted to an absolute path relative to the current binary
   directory. This is necessary because doxygen will normally be run from a
   directory within the source tree so that relative source paths work as
   expected. If this directory does not exist, it will be recursively created
   prior to executing the doxygen commands.

To change any of these defaults or override any other Doxygen config option,
set relevant variables before calling ``doxygen_add_docs()``. For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set(DOXYGEN_GENERATE_HTML NO)
    set(DOXYGEN_GENERATE_MAN YES)

    doxygen_add_docs(
        doxygen
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}
        COMMENT "Generate man pages"
    )

A number of Doxygen config options accept lists of values, but Doxygen requires
them to be separated by whitespace. CMake variables hold lists as a string with
items separated by semi-colons, so a conversion needs to be performed. The
``doxygen_add_docs()`` command specifically checks the following Doxygen config
options and will convert their associated CMake variable's contents into the
required form if set.

There are situations where it may be undesirable for a particular config option
to be automatically quoted by ``doxygen_add_docs()``, such as ``ALIASES`` which
may need to include its own embedded quoting.  The ``DOXYGEN_VERBATIM_VARS``
variable can be used to specify a list of Doxygen variables (including the
leading ``DOXYGEN_`` prefix) which should not be quoted.  The project is then
responsible for ensuring that those variables' values make sense when placed
directly in the Doxygen input file.  In the case of list variables, list items
are still separated by spaces, it is only the automatic quoting that is
skipped.  For example, the following allows ``doxygen_add_docs()`` to apply
quoting to ``DOXYGEN_PROJECT_BRIEF``, but not each item in the
``DOXYGEN_ALIASES`` list (:ref:`bracket syntax <Bracket Argument>` can also
be used to make working with embedded quotes easier):

 set(DOXYGEN_PROJECT_BRIEF "String with spaces")
 set(DOXYGEN_ALIASES
     [[somealias="@some_command param"]]
     "anotherAlias=@foobar"
 )
 set(DOXYGEN_VERBATIM_VARS DOXYGEN_ALIASES)

The resultant ``Doxyfile`` will contain the following lines:

 PROJECT_BRIEF = "String with spaces"
 ALIASES       = somealias="@some_command param" anotherAlias=@foobar

Deprecated Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For compatibility with previous versions of CMake, the following variables
are also defined but they are deprecated and should no longer be used:

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE

  The path to the ``doxygen`` command. If projects need to refer to the
  ``doxygen`` executable directly, they should use the ``Doxygen::doxygen``
  import target instead.

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_DOT_FOUND

  True if the ``dot`` executable was found.

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE

  The path to the ``dot`` command. If projects need to refer to the ``dot``
  executable directly, they should use the ``Doxygen::dot`` import target
  instead.

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_DOT_PATH

  The path to the directory containing the ``dot`` executable as reported in
  ``DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE``. The path may have forward slashes even on Windows
  and is not suitable for direct substitution into a ``Doxyfile.in`` template.
  If you need this value, get the ``IMPORTED_LOCATION`` property of the
  ``Doxygen::dot`` target and use ``get_filename_component()`` to extract
  the directory part of that path. You may also want to consider using
  ``file(TO_NATIVE_PATH)`` to prepare the path for a Doxygen
  configuration file.


Deprecated Hint Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_SKIP_DOT

  This variable has no effect for the component form of ``find_package``.
  In backward compatibility mode (i.e. without components list) it prevents
  the finder module from searching for Graphviz's ``dot`` utility.


FindEXPAT
---------

Find the native Expat headers and library.

Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` targets:

``EXPAT::EXPAT``
  The Expat ``expat`` library, if found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables in your project:

``EXPAT_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  where to find expat.h, etc.
``EXPAT_LIBRARIES``
  the libraries to link against to use Expat.
``EXPAT_FOUND``
  true if the Expat headers and libraries were found.


FindFLEX
--------

Find flex executable and provides a macro to generate custom build rules



The module defines the following variables:

::

 FLEX_FOUND - true is flex executable is found
 FLEX_EXECUTABLE - the path to the flex executable
 FLEX_VERSION - the version of flex
 FLEX_LIBRARIES - The flex libraries
 FLEX_INCLUDE_DIRS - The path to the flex headers

The minimum required version of flex can be specified using the
standard syntax, e.g.  find_package(FLEX 2.5.13)



If flex is found on the system, the module provides the macro:

::

 FLEX_TARGET(Name FlexInput FlexOutput
             [COMPILE_FLAGS <string>]
             [DEFINES_FILE <string>]
             )

which creates a custom command to generate the <FlexOutput> file from
the <FlexInput> file.  If COMPILE_FLAGS option is specified, the next
parameter is added to the flex command line. If flex is configured to
output a header file, the DEFINES_FILE option may be used to specify its
name. Name is an alias used to get details of this custom command.
Indeed the macro defines the following variables:

::

 FLEX_${Name}_DEFINED - true is the macro ran successfully
 FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUTS - the source file generated by the custom rule, an
 alias for FlexOutput
 FLEX_${Name}_INPUT - the flex source file, an alias for ${FlexInput}
 FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUT_HEADER - the header flex output, if any.

Flex scanners often use tokens defined by Bison: the code generated
by Flex depends of the header generated by Bison.  This module also
defines a macro:

::

 ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(FlexTarget BisonTarget)

which adds the required dependency between a scanner and a parser
where <FlexTarget> and <BisonTarget> are the first parameters of
respectively FLEX_TARGET and BISON_TARGET macros.

::

 ====================================================================
 Example:

::

 find_package(BISON)
 find_package(FLEX)

::

 BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp)
 FLEX_TARGET(MyScanner lexer.l  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/lexer.cpp)
 ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(MyScanner MyParser)

::

  include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})
  add_executable(Foo
     Foo.cc
     ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS}
     ${FLEX_MyScanner_OUTPUTS}
  )
 ====================================================================

::

 GTK_INCLUDE_DIR   - Directories to include to use GTK
 GTK_LIBRARIES     - Files to link against to use GTK
 GTK_FOUND         - GTK was found
 GTK_GL_FOUND      - GTK's GL features were found

FindHDF5
--------

Find HDF5, a library for reading and writing self describing array data.


This module invokes the HDF5 wrapper compiler that should be installed
alongside HDF5.  Depending upon the HDF5 Configuration, the wrapper
compiler is called either h5cc or h5pcc.  If this succeeds, the module
will then call the compiler with the -show argument to see what flags
are used when compiling an HDF5 client application.

The module will optionally accept the COMPONENTS argument.  If no
COMPONENTS are specified, then the find module will default to finding
only the HDF5 C library.  If one or more COMPONENTS are specified, the
module will attempt to find the language bindings for the specified
components.  The only valid components are C, CXX, Fortran, HL, and
Fortran_HL.  If the COMPONENTS argument is not given, the module will
attempt to find only the C bindings.

This module will read the variable
HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES to determine whether or not to prefer a
static link to a dynamic link for HDF5 and all of it's dependencies.
To use this feature, make sure that the HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES
variable is set before the call to find_package.

To provide the module with a hint about where to find your HDF5
installation, you can set the environment variable HDF5_ROOT.  The
Find module will then look in this path when searching for HDF5
executables, paths, and libraries.

Both the serial and parallel HDF5 wrappers are considered and the first
directory to contain either one will be used.  In the event that both appear
in the same directory the serial version is preferentially selected. This
behavior can be reversed by setting the variable HDF5_PREFER_PARALLEL to
true.

In addition to finding the includes and libraries required to compile
an HDF5 client application, this module also makes an effort to find
tools that come with the HDF5 distribution that may be useful for
regression testing.

Note that ``<C>`` is the uppercased name of the component.

This module reads hints about search results from::

 Ice_HOME - the root of the Ice installation

The environment variable ``ICE_HOME`` may also be used; the
Ice_HOME variable takes precedence.

.. note::
  On Windows, Ice 3.7.0 and later provide libraries via the NuGet
  package manager.  Appropriate NuGet packages will be searched for
  using ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``, or alternatively ``Ice_HOME`` may be
  set to the location of a specific NuGet package to restrict the
  search.

The following cache variables may also be set::

 Ice_<P>_EXECUTABLE - the path to executable <P>
 Ice_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory containing the Ice headers
 Ice_SLICE_DIR - the directory containing the Ice slice interface
                 definitions
 Ice_<C>_LIBRARY - the library for component <C>

.. note::

  In most cases none of the above variables will require setting,
  unless multiple Ice versions are available and a specific version
  is required.  On Windows, the most recent version of Ice will be
  found through the registry.  On Unix, the programs, headers and
  libraries will usually be in standard locations, but Ice_SLICE_DIRS
  might not be automatically detected (commonly known locations are
  searched).  All the other variables are defaulted using Ice_HOME,
  if set.  It's possible to set Ice_HOME and selectively specify
  alternative locations for the other components; this might be
  required for e.g. newer versions of Visual Studio if the
  heuristics are not sufficient to identify the correct programs and
  libraries for the specific Visual Studio version.

Other variables one may set to control this module are::

 Ice_DEBUG - Set to ON to enable debug output from FindIce.

FindIcotool

``in``; any of the names may be used, and the appropriate
platform-specific library name will be automatically selected.

This module reports information about the ICU installation in
several variables.  General variables::

 ICU_VERSION - ICU release version
 ICU_FOUND - true if the main programs and libraries were found

ICU_ROOT variable takes precedence.

The following cache variables may also be set::

 ICU_<P>_EXECUTABLE - the path to executable <P>
 ICU_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory containing the ICU headers
 ICU_<C>_LIBRARY - the library for component <C>

.. note::

FindIconv
---------

This module finds the ``iconv()`` POSIX.1 functions on the system.
These functions might be provided in the regular C library or externally
in the form of an additional library.

The following variables are provided to indicate iconv support:

.. variable:: Iconv_FOUND

  Variable indicating if the iconv support was found.

.. variable:: Iconv_INCLUDE_DIRS

  The directories containing the iconv headers.

.. variable:: Iconv_LIBRARIES

  The iconv libraries to be linked.

.. variable:: Iconv_IS_BUILT_IN

  A variable indicating whether iconv support is stemming from the
  C library or not. Even if the C library provides `iconv()`, the presence of
  an external `libiconv` implementation might lead to this being false.

Additionally, the following ``IMPORTED`` target is being provided:

.. variable:: Iconv::Iconv

  Imported target for using iconv.

The following cache variables may also be set:

.. variable:: Iconv_INCLUDE_DIR

  The directory containing the iconv headers.

.. variable:: Iconv_LIBRARY

  The iconv library (if not implicitly given in the C library).

.. note::
  On POSIX platforms, iconv might be part of the C library and the cache
  variables ``Iconv_INCLUDE_DIR`` and ``Iconv_LIBRARY`` might be empty.


FindIntl
--------

Find the Gettext libintl headers and libraries.

This module reports information about the Gettext libintl
installation in several variables.  General variables::

 Intl_FOUND - true if the libintl headers and libraries were found
 Intl_INCLUDE_DIRS - the directory containing the libintl headers
 Intl_LIBRARIES - libintl libraries to be linked

The following cache variables may also be set::

 Intl_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory containing the libintl headers
 Intl_LIBRARY - the libintl library (if any)

.. note::
  On some platforms, such as Linux with GNU libc, the gettext
  functions are present in the C standard library and libintl
  is not required.  ``Intl_LIBRARIES`` will be empty in this
  case.

.. note::
  If you wish to use the Gettext tools (``msgmerge``,
  ``msgfmt``, etc.), use ``FindGettext``.

FindITK
-------

This module no longer exists.

This module existed in versions of CMake prior to 3.1, but became
only a thin wrapper around ``find_package(ITK NO_MODULE)`` to
provide compatibility for projects using long-outdated conventions.
Now ``find_package(ITK)`` will search for ``ITKConfig.cmake``
directly.

FindJasper
----------

Try to find the Jasper JPEG2000 library

Once done this will define

::

 JASPER_FOUND - system has Jasper
 JASPER_INCLUDE_DIR - the Jasper include directory

FindMatlab
----------

Finds Matlab or Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR) and provides Matlab tools,
libraries and compilers to CMake.

This package primary purpose is to find the libraries associated with Matlab
or the MCR in order to be able to build Matlab extensions (mex files). It
can also be used:

* to run specific commands in Matlab in case Matlab is available
* for declaring Matlab unit test
* to retrieve various information from Matlab (mex extensions, versions and
  release queries, ...)

The module supports the following components:

* ``ENG_LIBRARY`` and ``MAT_LIBRARY``: respectively the ``ENG`` and ``MAT``
  libraries of Matlab
* ``MAIN_PROGRAM`` the Matlab binary program. Note that this component is not
  available on the MCR version, and will yield an error if the MCR is found
  instead of the regular Matlab installation.
* ``MEX_COMPILER`` the MEX compiler.
* ``MCC_COMPILER`` the MCC compiler, included with the Matlab Compiler add-on.
* ``SIMULINK`` the Simulink environment.

.. note::

  The version given to the ``find_package()`` directive is the Matlab
  **version**, which should not be confused with the Matlab *release* name
  (eg. `R2014`).
  The ``matlab_get_version_from_release_name()`` and
  ``matlab_get_release_name_from_version()`` provide a mapping
  between the release name and the version.

The variable ``Matlab_ROOT_DIR`` may be specified in order to give
the path of the desired Matlab version. Otherwise, the behaviour is platform
specific:

* Windows: The installed versions of Matlab/MCR are retrieved from the
  Windows registry
* OS X: The installed versions of Matlab/MCR are given by the MATLAB
  default installation paths in ``/Application``. If no such application is
  found, it falls back to the one that might be accessible from the ``PATH``.
* Unix: The desired Matlab should be accessible from the ``PATH``. This does
  not work for MCR installation and ``Matlab_ROOT_DIR`` should be
  specified on this platform.

Additional information is provided when ``MATLAB_FIND_DEBUG`` is set.
When a Matlab/MCR installation is found automatically and the ``MATLAB_VERSION``
is not given, the version is queried from Matlab directly (on Windows this
may pop up a Matlab window) or from the MCR installation.

The mapping of the release names and the version of Matlab is performed by
defining pairs (name, version).  The variable
``MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS`` may be provided before the call to
the ``find_package()`` in order to handle additional versions.

A Matlab scripts can be added to the set of tests using the
``matlab_add_unit_test()``. By default, the Matlab unit test framework
will be used (>= 2013a) to run this script, but regular ``.m`` files
returning an exit code can be used as well (0 indicating a success).

  returns the version from the release name
``matlab_get_release_name_from_version()``
  returns the release name from the Matlab version

``matlab_add_unit_test()``
  adds a Matlab unit test file as a test to the project.
``matlab_extract_all_installed_versions_from_registry()``

  installation path.


Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Symbol clash in a MEX target**
  By default, every symbols inside a MEX
  file defined with the command ``matlab_add_mex()`` have hidden
  visibility, except for the entry point. This is the default behaviour of
  the MEX compiler, which lowers the risk of symbol collision between the
  libraries shipped with Matlab, and the libraries to which the MEX file is
  linking to. This is also the default on Windows platforms.

  However, this is not sufficient in certain case, where for instance your
  MEX file is linking against libraries that are already loaded by Matlab,
  even if those libraries have different SONAMES.
  A possible solution is to hide the symbols of the libraries to which the
  MEX target is linking to. This can be achieved in GNU GCC compilers with
  the linker option ``-Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL``.

**Tests using GPU resources**
  in case your MEX file is using the GPU and
  in order to be able to run unit tests on this MEX file, the GPU resources
  should be properly released by Matlab. A possible solution is to make
  Matlab aware of the use of the GPU resources in the session, which can be
  performed by a command such as ``D = gpuDevice()`` at the beginning of
  the test script (or via a fixture).


Reference
^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: Matlab_ROOT_DIR

   The root folder of the Matlab installation. If set before the call to
   ``find_package()``, the module will look for the components in that
   path. If not set, then an automatic search of Matlab
   will be performed. If set, it should point to a valid version of Matlab.

.. variable:: MATLAB_FIND_DEBUG

   If set, the lookup of Matlab and the intermediate configuration steps are
   outputted to the console.

.. variable:: MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS

  If set, specifies additional versions of Matlab that may be looked for.
  The variable should be a list of strings, organised by pairs of release
  name and versions, such as follows::

   set(MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
       "release_name1=corresponding_version1"
       "release_name2=corresponding_version2"
       ...
       )

 Example::

   set(MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
       "R2013b=8.2"
       "R2013a=8.1"
       "R2012b=8.0")

 The order of entries in this list matters when several versions of
 Matlab are installed. The priority is set according to the ordering in
 this list.

.. command:: matlab_get_version_from_release_name

  Returns the version of Matlab (17.58) from a release name (R2017k)

.. command:: matlab_get_release_name_from_version

  Returns the release name (R2017k) from the version of Matlab (17.58)

.. command:: matlab_extract_all_installed_versions_from_registry

  This function parses the registry and founds the Matlab versions that are
  installed. The found versions are returned in `matlab_versions`.
  Set `win64` to `TRUE` if the 64 bit version of Matlab should be looked for
  The returned list contains all versions under
  ``HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Mathworks\\MATLAB`` and
  ``HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Mathworks\\MATLAB Runtime`` or an empty list in case an
  error occurred (or nothing found).

  .. note::

 Only the versions are provided. No check is made over the existence of the
 installation referenced in the registry,

.. command:: matlab_get_all_valid_matlab_roots_from_registry

  Populates the Matlab root with valid versions of Matlab or
  Matlab Runtime (MCR).
  The returned matlab_roots is organized in triplets
  ``(type,version_number,matlab_root_path)``, where ``type``
  indicates either ``MATLAB`` or ``MCR``.

   matlab_get_version_from_matlab_run(
       matlab_binary_path
       matlab_list_versions)

 ``matlab_binary_path``
   the location of the `matlab` binary executable
 ``matlab_list_versions``
   the version extracted from Matlab

.. command:: matlab_add_unit_test

  Adds a Matlab unit test to the test set of cmake/ctest.
  This command requires the component ``MAIN_PROGRAM`` and hence is not
  available for an MCR installation.

  The unit test uses the Matlab unittest framework (default, available
  starting Matlab 2013b+) except if the option ``NO_UNITTEST_FRAMEWORK``
  is given.

  The function expects one Matlab test script file to be given.
  In the case ``NO_UNITTEST_FRAMEWORK`` is given, the unittest script file
  should contain the script to be run, plus an exit command with the exit
  value. This exit value will be passed to the ctest framework (0 success,
  non 0 failure). Additional arguments accepted by ``add_test()`` can be
  passed through ``TEST_ARGS`` (eg. ``CONFIGURATION <config> ...``).

   If this is not set, then the following is run:
   ``runtests('matlab_file_name'), exit(max([ans(1,:).Failed]))``
   where ``matlab_file_name`` is the ``UNITTEST_FILE`` without the extension.
 ``UNITTEST_PRECOMMAND``
   Matlab script command to be ran before the file
   containing the test (eg. GPU device initialisation based on CMake
   variables).
 ``TIMEOUT``
   the test timeout in seconds. Defaults to 180 seconds as the
   Matlab unit test may hang.
 ``ADDITIONAL_PATH``
   a list of paths to add to the Matlab path prior to
   running the unit test.

   a list of additional option in order
   to run Matlab from the command line.
   ``-nosplash -nodesktop -nodisplay`` are always added.
 ``TEST_ARGS``
   Additional options provided to the add_test command. These
   options are added to the default options (eg. "CONFIGURATIONS Release")
 ``NO_UNITTEST_FRAMEWORK``
   when set, indicates that the test should not
   use the unittest framework of Matlab (available for versions >= R2013a).
 ``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
   This will be the working directory for the test. If specified it will
   also be the output directory used for the log file of the test run.
   If not specified the temporary directory ``${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Matlab`` will
   be used as the working directory and the log location.

.. command:: matlab_add_mex

  Adds a Matlab MEX target.
  This commands compiles the given sources with the current tool-chain in
  order to produce a MEX file. The final name of the produced output may be
  specified, as well as additional link libraries, and a documentation entry
  for the MEX file. Remaining arguments of the call are passed to the
  ``add_library()`` or ``add_executable()`` command.

  ::

    matlab_add_mex(
        NAME <name>
        [EXECUTABLE | MODULE | SHARED]

   the name of the target without any prefix and
   with ``Matlab_MEX_EXTENSION`` suffix.
 ``DOCUMENTATION``
   if given, the file ``file.txt`` will be considered as
   being the documentation file for the MEX file. This file is copied into
   the same folder without any processing, with the same name as the final
   mex file, and with extension `.m`. In that case, typing ``help <name>``
   in Matlab prints the documentation contained in this file.
 ``R2017b`` or ``R2018a`` may be given to specify the version of the C API
   to use: ``R2017b`` specifies the traditional (separate complex) C API,
   and corresponds to the ``-R2017b`` flag for the `mex` command. ``R2018a``
   specifies the new interleaved complex C API, and corresponds to the
   ``-R2018a`` flag for the `mex` command. Ignored if MATLAB version prior
   to R2018a. Defaults to ``R2017b``.
 ``MODULE`` or ``SHARED`` may be given to specify the type of library to be
   created. ``EXECUTABLE`` may be given to create an executable instead of
   a library. If no type is given explicitly, the type is ``SHARED``.

FindMPI
-------

Find a Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation.

The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library used to write
high-performance distributed-memory parallel applications, and is
typically deployed on a cluster.  MPI is a standard interface (defined
by the MPI forum) for which many implementations are available.

Variables for using MPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The module exposes the components ``C``, ``CXX``, ``MPICXX`` and ``Fortran``.
Each of these controls the various MPI languages to search for.
The difference between ``CXX`` and ``MPICXX`` is that ``CXX`` refers to the
MPI C API being usable from C++, whereas ``MPICXX`` refers to the MPI-2 C++ API
that was removed again in MPI-3.

Depending on the enabled components the following variables will be set:

``MPI_FOUND``
  Variable indicating that MPI settings for all requested languages have been found.
  If no components are specified, this is true if MPI settings for all enabled languages
  were detected. Note that the ``MPICXX`` component does not affect this variable.
``MPI_VERSION``
  Minimal version of MPI detected among the requested languages, or all enabled languages
  if no components were specified.

This module will set the following variables per language in your
project, where ``<lang>`` is one of C, CXX, or Fortran:

``MPI_<lang>_FOUND``
  Variable indicating the MPI settings for ``<lang>`` were found and that
  simple MPI test programs compile with the provided settings.
``MPI_<lang>_COMPILER``
  MPI compiler for ``<lang>`` if such a program exists.
``MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  Compilation options for MPI programs in ``<lang>``, given as a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>`.
``MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``
  Compilation definitions for MPI programs in ``<lang>``, given as a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>`.
``MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  Include path(s) for MPI header.
``MPI_<lang>_LINK_FLAGS``
  Linker flags for MPI programs.
``MPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES``
  All libraries to link MPI programs against.

Additionally, the following ``IMPORTED`` targets are defined:

``MPI::MPI_<lang>``
  Target for using MPI from ``<lang>``.

The following variables indicating which bindings are present will be defined:

``MPI_MPICXX_FOUND``
  Variable indicating whether the MPI-2 C++ bindings are present (introduced in MPI-2, removed with MPI-3).
``MPI_Fortran_HAVE_F77_HEADER``
  True if the Fortran 77 header ``mpif.h`` is available.
``MPI_Fortran_HAVE_F90_MODULE``
  True if the Fortran 90 module ``mpi`` can be used for accessing MPI (MPI-2 and higher only).
``MPI_Fortran_HAVE_F08_MODULE``
  True if the Fortran 2008 ``mpi_f08`` is available to MPI programs (MPI-3 and higher only).

If possible, the MPI version will be determined by this module. The facilities to detect the MPI version
were introduced with MPI-1.2, and therefore cannot be found for older MPI versions.

``MPI_<lang>_VERSION_MAJOR``
  Major version of MPI implemented for ``<lang>`` by the MPI distribution.
``MPI_<lang>_VERSION_MINOR``
  Minor version of MPI implemented for ``<lang>`` by the MPI distribution.
``MPI_<lang>_VERSION``
  MPI version implemented for ``<lang>`` by the MPI distribution.

Note that there's no variable for the C bindings being accessible through ``mpi.h``, since the MPI standards
always have required this binding to work in both C and C++ code.

For running MPI programs, the module sets the following variables

``MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE``
  Executable for running MPI programs, if such exists.
``MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG``
  Flag to pass to ``mpiexec`` before giving it the number of processors to run on.
``MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS``
  Number of MPI processors to utilize. Defaults to the number
  of processors detected on the host system.
``MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS``
  Flags to pass to ``mpiexec`` directly before the executable to run.
``MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS``
  Flags to pass to ``mpiexec`` after other flags.

Variables for locating MPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module performs a three step search for an MPI implementation:

1. Check if the compiler has MPI support built-in. This is the case if the user passed a
   compiler wrapper as ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER`` or if they're on a Cray system.
2. Attempt to find an MPI compiler wrapper and determine the compiler information from it.
3. Try to find an MPI implementation that does not ship such a wrapper by guessing settings.
   Currently, only Microsoft MPI and MPICH2 on Windows are supported.

For controlling the second step, the following variables may be set:

``MPI_<lang>_COMPILER``
  Search for the specified compiler wrapper and use it.
``MPI_<lang>_COMPILER_FLAGS``
  Flags to pass to the MPI compiler wrapper during interrogation. Some compiler wrappers
  support linking debug or tracing libraries if a specific flag is passed and this variable
  may be used to obtain them.
``MPI_COMPILER_FLAGS``
  Used to initialize ``MPI_<lang>_COMPILER_FLAGS`` if no language specific flag has been given.
  Empty by default.
``MPI_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX``
  A suffix which is appended to all names that are being looked for. For instance you may set this
  to ``.mpich`` or ``.openmpi`` to prefer the one or the other on Debian and its derivatives.

In order to control the guessing step, the following variable may be set:

``MPI_GUESS_LIBRARY_NAME``
  Valid values are ``MSMPI`` and ``MPICH2``. If set, only the given library will be searched for.
  By default, ``MSMPI`` will be preferred over ``MPICH2`` if both are available.
  This also sets ``MPI_SKIP_COMPILER_WRAPPER`` to ``true``, which may be overridden.

Each of the search steps may be skipped with the following control variables:

``MPI_ASSUME_NO_BUILTIN_MPI``
  If true, the module assumes that the compiler itself does not provide an MPI implementation and
  skips to step 2.
``MPI_SKIP_COMPILER_WRAPPER``
  If true, no compiler wrapper will be searched for.
``MPI_SKIP_GUESSING``
  If true, the guessing step will be skipped.

Additionally, the following control variable is available to change search behavior:

``MPI_CXX_SKIP_MPICXX``
  Add some definitions that will disable the MPI-2 C++ bindings.
  Currently supported are MPICH, Open MPI, Platform MPI and derivatives thereof,
  for example MVAPICH or Intel MPI.

If the find procedure fails for a variable ``MPI_<lang>_WORKS``, then the settings detected by or passed to
the module did not work and even a simple MPI test program failed to compile.

If all of these parameters were not sufficient to find the right MPI implementation, a user may
disable the entire autodetection process by specifying both a list of libraries in ``MPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES``
and a list of include directories in ``MPI_<lang>_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS``.
Any other variable may be set in addition to these two. The module will then validate the MPI settings and store the
settings in the cache.

Cache variables for MPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The variable ``MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` will be assembled from the following variables.
For C and CXX:

``MPI_<lang>_HEADER_DIR``
  Location of the ``mpi.h`` header on disk.

For Fortran:

``MPI_Fortran_F77_HEADER_DIR``
  Location of the Fortran 77 header ``mpif.h``, if it exists.
``MPI_Fortran_MODULE_DIR``
  Location of the ``mpi`` or ``mpi_f08`` modules, if available.

For all languages the following variables are additionally considered:

``MPI_<lang>_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of paths needed in addition to the normal include directories.
``MPI_<include_name>_INCLUDE_DIR``
  Path variables for include folders referred to by ``<include_name>``.
``MPI_<lang>_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_VARS``
  A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of ``<include_name>`` that will be added to the include locations of ``<lang>``.

The variable ``MPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES`` will be assembled from the following variables:

``MPI_<lib_name>_LIBRARY``
  The location of a library called ``<lib_name>`` for use with MPI.
``MPI_<lang>_LIB_NAMES``
  A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of ``<lib_name>`` that will be added to the include locations of ``<lang>``.

Usage of mpiexec
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using ``MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE`` to execute MPI applications, you should typically
use all of the ``MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE`` flags as follows:

::

 ${MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} ${MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS}
   ${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS

where ``EXECUTABLE`` is the MPI program, and ``ARGS`` are the arguments to
pass to the MPI program.

Advanced variables for using MPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The module can perform some advanced feature detections upon explicit request.

**Important notice:** The following checks cannot be performed without *executing* an MPI test program.
Consider the special considerations for the behavior of ``try_run()`` during cross compilation.
Moreover, running an MPI program can cause additional issues, like a firewall notification on some systems.
You should only enable these detections if you absolutely need the information.

If the following variables are set to true, the respective search will be performed:

``MPI_DETERMINE_Fortran_CAPABILITIES``
  Determine for all available Fortran bindings what the values of ``MPI_SUBARRAYS_SUPPORTED`` and
  ``MPI_ASYNC_PROTECTS_NONBLOCKING`` are and make their values available as ``MPI_Fortran_<binding>_SUBARRAYS``
  and ``MPI_Fortran_<binding>_ASYNCPROT``, where ``<binding>`` is one of ``F77_HEADER``, ``F90_MODULE`` and
  ``F08_MODULE``.
``MPI_DETERMINE_LIBRARY_VERSION``
  For each language, find the output of ``MPI_Get_library_version`` and make it available as ``MPI_<lang>_LIBRARY_VERSION``.
  This information is usually tied to the runtime component of an MPI implementation and might differ depending on ``<lang>``.
  Note that the return value is entirely implementation defined. This information might be used to identify
  the MPI vendor and for example pick the correct one of multiple third party binaries that matches the MPI vendor.

Backward Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For backward compatibility with older versions of FindMPI, these
variables are set, but deprecated:

::

 MPI_COMPILER        MPI_LIBRARY        MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY
 MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS   MPI_INCLUDE_PATH   MPI_LINK_FLAGS
 MPI_LIBRARIES

In new projects, please use the ``MPI_<lang>_XXX`` equivalents.
Additionally, the following variables are deprecated:

``MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_FLAGS``
  Use ``MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_OPTIONS`` and ``MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` instead.
``MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_PATH``
  For consumption use ``MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` and for specifying folders use ``MPI_<lang>_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS`` instead.
``MPIEXEC``
  Use ``MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE`` instead.

FindODBC
--------

Find an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) include directory and library.

On Windows, when building with Visual Studio, this module assumes the ODBC
library is provided by the available Windows SDK.

On Unix, this module allows to search for ODBC library provided by
unixODBC or iODBC implementations of ODBC API.
This module reads hint about location of the config program:

.. variable:: ODBC_CONFIG

  Location of odbc_config or iodbc-config program

Otherwise, this module tries to find the config program,
first from unixODBC, then from iODBC.
If no config program found, this module searches for ODBC header
and library in list of known locations.

Imported targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` targets:

.. variable:: ODBC::ODBC

  Imported target for using the ODBC library, if found.

Result variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: ODBC_FOUND

  Set to true if ODBC library found, otherwise false or undefined.

.. variable:: ODBC_INCLUDE_DIRS

  Paths to include directories listed in one variable for use by ODBC client.
  May be empty on Windows, where the include directory corresponding to the
  expected Windows SDK is already available in the compilation environment.

.. variable:: ODBC_LIBRARIES

  Paths to libraries to linked against to use ODBC.
  May just a library name on Windows, where the library directory corresponding
  to the expected Windows SDK is already available in the compilation environment.

.. variable:: ODBC_CONFIG

  Path to unixODBC or iODBC config program, if found or specified.

Cache variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For users who wish to edit and control the module behavior, this module
reads hints about search locations from the following variables:

.. variable:: ODBC_INCLUDE_DIR

  Path to ODBC include directory with ``sql.h`` header.

.. variable:: ODBC_LIBRARY

  Path to ODBC library to be linked.

These variables should not be used directly by project code.

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

On Windows, this module does not search for iODBC.
On Unix, there is no way to prefer unixODBC over iODBC, or vice versa,
other than providing the config program location using the ``ODBC_CONFIG``.
This module does not allow to search for a specific ODBC driver.


FindOpenACC
-----------

Detect OpenACC support by the compiler.

This module can be used to detect OpenACC support in a compiler.
If the compiler supports OpenACC, the flags required to compile with
OpenACC support are returned in variables for the different languages.
Currently, only PGI, GNU and Cray compilers are supported.

Variables
^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables per language in your
project, where ``<lang>`` is one of C, CXX, or Fortran:

``OpenACC_<lang>_FOUND``
  Variable indicating if OpenACC support for ``<lang>`` was detected.
``OpenACC_<lang>_FLAGS``
  OpenACC compiler flags for ``<lang>``, separated by spaces.

The module will also try to provide the OpenACC version variables:

``OpenACC_<lang>_SPEC_DATE``
  Date of the OpenACC specification implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenACC_<lang>_VERSION_MAJOR``
  Major version of OpenACC implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenACC_<lang>_VERSION_MINOR``
  Minor version of OpenACC implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenACC_<lang>_VERSION``
  OpenACC version implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.

The specification date is formatted as given in the OpenACC standard:
``yyyymm`` where ``yyyy`` and ``mm`` represents the year and month of
the OpenACC specification implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.

Input Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``OpenACC_ACCEL_TARGET=<target>``
If set, will the correct target accelerator flag set to the <target> will
be returned with OpenACC_<lang>_FLAGS.

FindOpenAL
----------



Locate OpenAL This module defines OPENAL_LIBRARY OPENAL_FOUND, if
false, do not try to link to OpenAL OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find
the headers

$OPENALDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$OPENALDIR used in building OpenAL.

Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
module.

FindOpenCL
----------

Try to find OpenCL

IMPORTED Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines ``IMPORTED`` target ``OpenCL::OpenCL``, if
OpenCL has been found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following variables::

 OpenCL_FOUND          - True if OpenCL was found
 OpenCL_INCLUDE_DIRS   - include directories for OpenCL
 OpenCL_LIBRARIES      - link against this library to use OpenCL
 OpenCL_VERSION_STRING - Highest supported OpenCL version (eg. 1.2)
 OpenCL_VERSION_MAJOR  - The major version of the OpenCL implementation
 OpenCL_VERSION_MINOR  - The minor version of the OpenCL implementation

The module will also define two cache variables::

 OpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR    - the OpenCL include directory
 OpenCL_LIBRARY        - the path to the OpenCL library

FindOpenGL
----------

FindModule for OpenGL and GLU.

Optional COMPONENTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module respects several optional COMPONENTS: ``EGL``, ``GLX``, and
``OpenGL``.  There are corresponding import targets for each of these flags.

IMPORTED Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the ``IMPORTED`` targets:

``OpenGL::GL``
 Defined to the platform-specific OpenGL libraries if the system has OpenGL.
``OpenGL::OpenGL``
 Defined to libOpenGL if the system is GLVND-based.
``OpenGL::GLU``
 Defined if the system has GLU.
``OpenGL::GLX``
 Defined if the system has GLX.
``OpenGL::EGL``
 Defined if the system has EGL.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module sets the following variables:

``OPENGL_FOUND``
 True, if the system has OpenGL and all components are found.
``OPENGL_XMESA_FOUND``
 True, if the system has XMESA.
``OPENGL_GLU_FOUND``
 True, if the system has GLU.
``OpenGL_OpenGL_FOUND``
 True, if the system has an OpenGL library.
``OpenGL_GLX_FOUND``
 True, if the system has GLX.
``OpenGL_EGL_FOUND``
 True, if the system has EGL.
``OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR``
 Path to the OpenGL include directory.
``OPENGL_EGL_INCLUDE_DIRS``
 Path to the EGL include directory.
``OPENGL_LIBRARIES``
 Paths to the OpenGL library, windowing system libraries, and GLU libraries.
 On Linux, this assumes GLX and is never correct for EGL-based targets.
 Clients are encouraged to use the ``OpenGL::*`` import targets instead.

Cache variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following cache variables may also be set:

``OPENGL_egl_LIBRARY``
 Path to the EGL library.
``OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY``
 Path to the GLU library.
``OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY``
 Path to the GLVND 'GLX' library.
``OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY``
 Path to the GLVND 'OpenGL' library
``OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY``
 Path to the OpenGL library.  New code should prefer the ``OpenGL::*`` import
 targets.

Linux-specific
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some Linux systems utilize GLVND as a new ABI for OpenGL.  GLVND separates
context libraries from OpenGL itself; OpenGL lives in "libOpenGL", and
contexts are defined in "libGLX" or "libEGL".  GLVND is currently the only way
to get OpenGL 3+ functionality via EGL in a manner portable across vendors.
Projects may use GLVND explicitly with target ``OpenGL::OpenGL`` and either
``OpenGL::GLX`` or ``OpenGL::EGL``.

Projects may use the ``OpenGL::GL`` target (or ``OPENGL_LIBRARIES`` variable)
to use legacy GL interfaces.  These will use the legacy GL library located
by ``OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY``, if available.  If ``OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY`` is empty or
not found and GLVND is available, the ``OpenGL::GL`` target will use GLVND
``OpenGL::OpenGL`` and ``OpenGL::GLX`` (and the ``OPENGL_LIBRARIES``
variable will use the corresponding libraries).  Thus, for non-EGL-based
Linux targets, the ``OpenGL::GL`` target is most portable.

A ``OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE`` variable may be set to specify the preferred way
to provide legacy GL interfaces in case multiple choices are available.
The value may be one of:

``GLVND``
 If the GLVND OpenGL and GLX libraries are available, prefer them.
 This forces ``OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY`` to be empty.
 This is the default if components were requested (since components
 correspond to GLVND libraries) or if policy ``CMP0072`` is
 set to ``NEW``.

``LEGACY``
 Prefer to use the legacy libGL library, if available.
 This is the default if no components were requested and
 policy ``CMP0072`` is not set to ``NEW``.

For EGL targets the client must rely on GLVND support on the user's system.
Linking should use the ``OpenGL::OpenGL OpenGL::EGL`` targets.  Using GLES*
libraries is theoretically possible in place of ``OpenGL::OpenGL``, but this
module does not currently support that; contributions welcome.

``OPENGL_egl_LIBRARY`` and ``OPENGL_EGL_INCLUDE_DIRS`` are defined in the case of
GLVND.  For non-GLVND Linux and other systems these are left undefined.

macOS-Specific
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On OSX FindOpenGL defaults to using the framework version of OpenGL. People
will have to change the cache values of OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY and
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to use OpenGL with X11 on OSX.

FindOpenMP
----------

Finds OpenMP support

This module can be used to detect OpenMP support in a compiler.  If
the compiler supports OpenMP, the flags required to compile with
OpenMP support are returned in variables for the different languages.
The variables may be empty if the compiler does not need a special
flag to support OpenMP.

Variables
^^^^^^^^^

The module exposes the components ``C``, ``CXX``, and ``Fortran``.
Each of these controls the various languages to search OpenMP support for.

Depending on the enabled components the following variables will be set:

``OpenMP_FOUND``
  Variable indicating that OpenMP flags for all requested languages have been found.
  If no components are specified, this is true if OpenMP settings for all enabled languages
  were detected.
``OpenMP_VERSION``
  Minimal version of the OpenMP standard detected among the requested languages,
  or all enabled languages if no components were specified.

This module will set the following variables per language in your
project, where ``<lang>`` is one of C, CXX, or Fortran:

``OpenMP_<lang>_FOUND``
  Variable indicating if OpenMP support for ``<lang>`` was detected.
``OpenMP_<lang>_FLAGS``
  OpenMP compiler flags for ``<lang>``, separated by spaces.

For linking with OpenMP code written in ``<lang>``, the following
variables are provided:

``OpenMP_<lang>_LIB_NAMES``
  :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries for OpenMP programs for ``<lang>``.
``OpenMP_<libname>_LIBRARY``
  Location of the individual libraries needed for OpenMP support in ``<lang>``.
``OpenMP_<lang>_LIBRARIES``
  A list of libraries needed to link with OpenMP code written in ``<lang>``.

Additionally, the module provides ``IMPORTED`` targets:

``OpenMP::OpenMP_<lang>``
  Target for using OpenMP from ``<lang>``.

Specifically for Fortran, the module sets the following variables:

``OpenMP_Fortran_HAVE_OMPLIB_HEADER``
  Boolean indicating if OpenMP is accessible through ``omp_lib.h``.
``OpenMP_Fortran_HAVE_OMPLIB_MODULE``
  Boolean indicating if OpenMP is accessible through the ``omp_lib`` Fortran module.

The module will also try to provide the OpenMP version variables:

``OpenMP_<lang>_SPEC_DATE``
  Date of the OpenMP specification implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenMP_<lang>_VERSION_MAJOR``
  Major version of OpenMP implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenMP_<lang>_VERSION_MINOR``
  Minor version of OpenMP implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenMP_<lang>_VERSION``
  OpenMP version implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.

The specification date is formatted as given in the OpenMP standard:
``yyyymm`` where ``yyyy`` and ``mm`` represents the year and month of
the OpenMP specification implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.

FindOpenSceneGraph
------------------

Find OpenSceneGraph

This module searches for the OpenSceneGraph core "osg" library as well
as OpenThreads, and whatever additional COMPONENTS (nodekits) that you
specify.

::

 See http://www.openscenegraph.org

NOTE: To use this module effectively you must either require CMake >=
2.6.3 with cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6.3) or download and place
FindOpenThreads.cmake, Findosg_functions.cmake, Findosg.cmake, and
Find<etc>.cmake files into your CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.

==================================

This module accepts the following variables (note mixed case)

::

 OpenSceneGraph_DEBUG - Enable debugging output

::

 OpenSceneGraph_MARK_AS_ADVANCED - Mark cache variables as advanced
                                   automatically

The following environment variables are also respected for finding the
OSG and it's various components.  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH can also be used
for this (see find_library() CMake documentation).

``<MODULE>_DIR``
  (where MODULE is of the form "OSGVOLUME" and there is a FindosgVolume.cmake file)
``OSG_DIR``
  ..
``OSGDIR``
  ..
``OSG_ROOT``
  ..


[CMake 2.8.10]: The CMake variable OSG_DIR can now be used as well to
influence detection, instead of needing to specify an environment
variable.

This module defines the following output variables:

::

 OPENSCENEGRAPH_FOUND - Was the OSG and all of the specified components found?

::

 OPENSCENEGRAPH_VERSION - The version of the OSG which was found

::

 OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS - Where to find the headers

::

 OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIBRARIES - The OSG libraries

================================== Example Usage:

::

 find_package(OpenSceneGraph 2.0.0 REQUIRED osgDB osgUtil)
     # libOpenThreads & libosg automatically searched
 include_directories(${OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS})

::

 add_executable(foo foo.cc)
 target_link_libraries(foo ${OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIBRARIES})

FindOpenSSL
-----------

Find the OpenSSL encryption library.

Optional COMPONENTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module supports two optional COMPONENTS: ``Crypto`` and ``SSL``.  Both
components have associated imported targets, as described below.

Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` targets:

``OpenSSL::SSL``
  The OpenSSL ``ssl`` library, if found.
``OpenSSL::Crypto``
  The OpenSSL ``crypto`` library, if found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables in your project:

``OPENSSL_FOUND``
  System has the OpenSSL library. If no components are requested it only
  requires the crypto library.
``OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The OpenSSL include directory.
``OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY``
  The OpenSSL crypto library.
``OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARY``
  The OpenSSL SSL library.
``OPENSSL_LIBRARIES``
  All OpenSSL libraries.
``OPENSSL_VERSION``
  This is set to ``$major.$minor.$revision$patch`` (e.g. ``0.9.8s``).

Hints
^^^^^

Set ``OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR`` to the root directory of an OpenSSL installation.
Set ``OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS`` to ``TRUE`` to look for static libraries.
Set ``OPENSSL_MSVC_STATIC_RT`` set ``TRUE`` to choose the MT version of the lib.

FindOpenThreads
---------------



OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library.  Its largest userbase
seems to OpenSceneGraph so you might notice I accept OSGDIR as an
environment path.  I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to
find OpenSceneGraph components.  Each component is separate and you
must opt in to each module.

Locate OpenThreads This module defines OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY
OPENTHREADS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to OpenThreads
OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers

$OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to
the ./configure --prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR used in building osg.

[CMake 2.8.10]: The CMake variables OPENTHREADS_DIR or OSG_DIR can now
be used as well to influence detection, instead of needing to specify
an environment variable.

Created by Eric Wing.

FindosgAnimation
----------------



This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph
components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each
module.  You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer
if needed) as these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you
control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular
module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't
work with your system as an example).  If you want to use a more
convenient module that includes everything, use the
FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.

Locate osgAnimation This module defines

OSGANIMATION_FOUND - Was osgAnimation found? OSGANIMATION_INCLUDE_DIR
- Where to find the headers OSGANIMATION_LIBRARIES - The libraries to
link against for the OSG (use this)

OSGANIMATION_LIBRARY - The OSG library OSGANIMATION_LIBRARY_DEBUG -
The OSG debug library

$OSGDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$OSGDIR used in building osg.

Created by Eric Wing.

FindosgDB
---------



This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph
components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each

FindPkgConfig
-------------

A ``pkg-config`` module for CMake.

Finds the ``pkg-config`` executable and adds the ``pkg_get_variable()``,
``pkg_check_modules()`` and ``pkg_search_module()`` commands. The
following variables will also be set:

``PKG_CONFIG_FOUND``
  if pkg-config executable was found
``PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE``
  pathname of the pkg-config program
``PKG_CONFIG_VERSION_STRING``
  version of pkg-config (since CMake 2.8.8)


.. command:: pkg_get_variable

  Retrieves the value of a pkg-config variable ``varName`` and stores it in the
  result variable ``resultVar`` in the calling scope.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_get_variable(<resultVar> <moduleName> <varName>)

  If ``pkg-config`` returns multiple values for the specified variable,
  ``resultVar`` will contain a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>`.

  For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_get_variable(GI_GIRDIR gobject-introspection-1.0 girdir)

.. command:: pkg_check_modules

  Checks for all the given modules, setting a variety of result variables in
  the calling scope.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_check_modules(<prefix>
                      [REQUIRED] [QUIET]
                      [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                      [IMPORTED_TARGET [GLOBAL]]
                      <moduleSpec> [<moduleSpec>...])

  When the ``REQUIRED`` argument is given, the command will fail with an error
  if module(s) could not be found.

  When the ``QUIET`` argument is given, no status messages will be printed.

  By default, if ``CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION`` is 3.1 or
  later, or if ``PKG_CONFIG_USE_CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` is set to a
  boolean ``True`` value, then the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``,
  ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH``, and ``CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH`` cache
  and environment variables will be added to the ``pkg-config`` search path.
  The ``NO_CMAKE_PATH`` and ``NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` arguments
  disable this behavior for the cache variables and environment variables
  respectively.

  The ``IMPORTED_TARGET`` argument will create an imported target named
  ``PkgConfig::<prefix>`` that can be passed directly as an argument to
  ``target_link_libraries()``. The ``GLOBAL`` argument will make the
  imported target available in global scope.

  Each ``<moduleSpec>`` can be either a bare module name or it can be a
  module name with a version constraint (operators ``=``, ``<``, ``>``,
  ``<=`` and ``>=`` are supported).  The following are examples for a module
  named ``foo`` with various constraints:

  - ``foo`` matches any version.
  - ``foo<2`` only matches versions before 2.
  - ``foo>=3.1`` matches any version from 3.1 or later.
  - ``foo=1.2.3`` requires that foo must be exactly version 1.2.3.

  The following variables may be set upon return.  Two sets of values exist:
  One for the common case (``<XXX> = <prefix>``) and another for the
  information ``pkg-config`` provides when called with the ``--static``
  option (``<XXX> = <prefix>_STATIC``).

  ``<XXX>_FOUND``
    set to 1 if module(s) exist
  ``<XXX>_LIBRARIES``
    only the libraries (without the '-l')
  ``<XXX>_LINK_LIBRARIES``
    the libraries and their absolute paths
  ``<XXX>_LIBRARY_DIRS``
    the paths of the libraries (without the '-L')
  ``<XXX>_LDFLAGS``
    all required linker flags
  ``<XXX>_LDFLAGS_OTHER``
    all other linker flags
  ``<XXX>_INCLUDE_DIRS``
    the '-I' preprocessor flags (without the '-I')
  ``<XXX>_CFLAGS``
    all required cflags
  ``<XXX>_CFLAGS_OTHER``
    the other compiler flags

  All but ``<XXX>_FOUND`` may be a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` if the
  associated variable returned from ``pkg-config`` has multiple values.

  There are some special variables whose prefix depends on the number of
  ``<moduleSpec>`` given.  When there is only one ``<moduleSpec>``,
  ``<YYY>`` will simply be ``<prefix>``, but if two or more ``<moduleSpec>``
  items are given, ``<YYY>`` will be ``<prefix>_<moduleName>``.

  ``<YYY>_VERSION``
    version of the module
  ``<YYY>_PREFIX``
    prefix directory of the module
  ``<YYY>_INCLUDEDIR``
    include directory of the module
  ``<YYY>_LIBDIR``
    lib directory of the module

  Examples:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0)

  Looks for any version of glib2.  If found, the output variable
  ``GLIB2_VERSION`` will hold the actual version found.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0>=2.10)

  Looks for at least version 2.10 of glib2.  If found, the output variable
  ``GLIB2_VERSION`` will hold the actual version found.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_check_modules (FOO glib-2.0>=2.10 gtk+-2.0)

  Looks for both glib2-2.0 (at least version 2.10) and any version of
  gtk2+-2.0.  Only if both are found will ``FOO`` be considered found.
  The ``FOO_glib-2.0_VERSION`` and ``FOO_gtk+-2.0_VERSION`` variables will be
  set to their respective found module versions.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_check_modules (XRENDER REQUIRED xrender)

  Requires any version of ``xrender``.  Example output variables set by a
  successful call::

 XRENDER_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11
 XRENDER_STATIC_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11;pthread;Xau;Xdmcp

.. command:: pkg_search_module

  The behavior of this command is the same as ``pkg_check_modules()``,
  except that rather than checking for all the specified modules, it searches
  for just the first successful match.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_search_module(<prefix>
                      [REQUIRED] [QUIET]
                      [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                      [IMPORTED_TARGET [GLOBAL]]
                      <moduleSpec> [<moduleSpec>...])

  Example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_search_module (BAR libxml-2.0 libxml2 libxml>=2)

Variables Affecting Behavior
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE

  This can be set to the path of the pkg-config executable.  If not provided,
  it will be set by the module as a result of calling ``find_program()``
  internally.  The ``PKG_CONFIG`` environment variable can be used as a hint.

.. variable:: PKG_CONFIG_USE_CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

  Specifies whether ``pkg_check_modules()`` and
  ``pkg_search_module()`` should add the paths in the
  ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``, ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH`` and
  ``CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH`` cache and environment variables to the
  ``pkg-config`` search path.

  If this variable is not set, this behavior is enabled by default if
  ``CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION`` is 3.1 or later, disabled
  otherwise.

FindPNG
-------

Find libpng, the official reference library for the PNG image format.

Imported targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` target:

``PNG::PNG``
  The libpng library, if found.

Result variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables in your project:

``PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  where to find png.h, etc.
``PNG_LIBRARIES``
  the libraries to link against to use PNG.
``PNG_DEFINITIONS``
  You should add_definitions(${PNG_DEFINITIONS}) before compiling code
  that includes png library files.
``PNG_FOUND``
  If false, do not try to use PNG.
``PNG_VERSION_STRING``
  the version of the PNG library found (since CMake 2.8.8)

Obsolete variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following variables may also be set, for backwards compatibility:

``PNG_LIBRARY``
  where to find the PNG library.
``PNG_INCLUDE_DIR``
  where to find the PNG headers (same as PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS)

Since PNG depends on the ZLib compression library, none of the above
will be defined unless ZLib can be found.

FindPostgreSQL
--------------

Find the PostgreSQL installation.

IMPORTED Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines ``IMPORTED`` target ``PostgreSQL::PostgreSQL``
if PostgreSQL has been found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables in your project:

``PostgreSQL_FOUND``
  True if PostgreSQL is found.
``PostgreSQL_LIBRARIES``
  the PostgreSQL libraries needed for linking
``PostgreSQL_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  the directories of the PostgreSQL headers
``PostgreSQL_LIBRARY_DIRS``
  the link directories for PostgreSQL libraries
``PostgreSQL_VERSION_STRING``
  the version of PostgreSQL found

FindProducer
------------



Though Producer isn't directly part of OpenSceneGraph, its primary
user is OSG so I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to find
OpenSceneGraph components.  You'll notice that I accept OSGDIR as an
environment path.

Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.  You
must also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as these modules won't do
it for you.  This is to allow you control over your own system piece
by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change
the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default
FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example).
If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything,
use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake
modules.

Locate Producer This module defines PRODUCER_LIBRARY PRODUCER_FOUND,
if false, do not try to link to Producer PRODUCER_INCLUDE_DIR, where
to find the headers

$PRODUCER_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$PRODUCER_DIR used in building osg.

Created by Eric Wing.

  will be searched for libraries and binaries.
``Protobuf_IMPORT_DIRS``
  List of additional directories to be searched for
  imported .proto files.

FindQt3
-------

Locate Qt include paths and libraries

This module defines:

::

 QT_INCLUDE_DIR    - where to find qt.h, etc.
 QT_LIBRARIES      - the libraries to link against to use Qt.
 QT_DEFINITIONS    - definitions to use when
                     compiling code that uses Qt.
 QT_FOUND          - If false, don't try to use Qt.
 QT_VERSION_STRING - the version of Qt found

If you need the multithreaded version of Qt, set QT_MT_REQUIRED to
TRUE

Also defined, but not for general use are:

::

 QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the moc tool.
 QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the uic tool.
 QT_QT_LIBRARY, where to find the Qt library.
 QT_QTMAIN_LIBRARY, where to find the qtmain
  library. This is only required by Qt3 on Windows.

FindQt4
-------

Finding and Using Qt4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module can be used to find Qt4.  The most important issue is that
the Qt4 qmake is available via the system path.  This qmake is then
used to detect basically everything else.  This module defines a
number of ``IMPORTED`` targets, macros and variables.

Typical usage could be something like:

 set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)
 set(CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR ON)
 find_package(Qt4 4.4.3 REQUIRED QtGui QtXml)
 add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(myexe Qt4::QtGui Qt4::QtXml)

.. note::

 When using ``IMPORTED`` targets, the qtmain.lib static library is
 automatically linked on Windows for ``WIN32``
 executables. To disable that globally, set the
 ``QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN`` variable before finding Qt4. To disable that
 for a particular executable, set the ``QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN`` target
 property to ``TRUE`` on the executable.

Qt Build Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Qt relies on some bundled tools for code generation, such as ``moc`` for
meta-object code generation,``uic`` for widget layout and population,
and ``rcc`` for virtual filesystem content generation.  These tools may be
automatically invoked by ``cmake(1)`` if the appropriate conditions
are met.  See ``cmake-qt(7)`` for more.

Qt Macros
^^^^^^^^^

In some cases it can be necessary or useful to invoke the Qt build tools in a
more-manual way. Several macros are available to add targets for such uses.

::

 macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... [TARGET tgt] OPTIONS ...)
       create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class with
       the Q_OBJECT declaration.  Per-directory preprocessor definitions
       are also added.  If the <tgt> is specified, the
       INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from
       the <tgt> are passed to moc.  Options may be given to moc, such as
       those found when executing "moc -help".

::

 macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
       create code from a list of Qt designer ui files.
       Options may be given to uic, such as those found
       when executing "uic -help"

::

 macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
       create code from a list of Qt resource files.
       Options may be given to rcc, such as those found
       when executing "rcc -help"

::

 macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile [TARGET tgt])
       creates a rule to run moc on infile and create outfile.
       Use this if for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isn't appropriate, e.g.
       because you need a custom filename for the moc file or something
       similar.  If the <tgt> is specified, the
       INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from
       the <tgt> are passed to moc.

::

 macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE(outfiles interface basename)
       Create the interface header and implementation files with the
       given basename from the given interface xml file and add it to
       the list of sources.

       You can pass additional parameters to the qdbusxml2cpp call by setting
       properties on the input file:

       INCLUDE the given file will be included in the generate interface header

       CLASSNAME the generated class is named accordingly

       NO_NAMESPACE the generated class is not wrapped in a namespace

::

 macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACES(outfiles inputfile ... )
       Create the interface header and implementation files
       for all listed interface xml files.
       The basename will be automatically determined from the name
       of the xml file.

       The source file properties described for
       QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE also apply here.

::

 macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_ADAPTOR(outfiles xmlfile parentheader parentclassname
                            [basename] [classname])
       create a dbus adaptor (header and implementation file) from the xml file
       describing the interface, and add it to the list of sources. The adaptor
       forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in parentheader and named
       parentclassname. The name of the generated files will be
       <basename>adaptor.{cpp,h} where basename defaults to the basename of the
       xml file.
       If <classname> is provided, then it will be used as the classname of the
       adaptor itself.

::

 macro QT4_GENERATE_DBUS_INTERFACE( header [interfacename] OPTIONS ...)
       generate the xml interface file from the given header.
       If the optional argument interfacename is omitted, the name of the
       interface file is constructed from the basename of the header with
       the suffix .xml appended.
       Options may be given to qdbuscpp2xml, such as those found when
       executing "qdbuscpp2xml --help"

::

 macro QT4_CREATE_TRANSLATION( qm_files directories ... sources ...
                               ts_files ... OPTIONS ...)
       out: qm_files
       in:  directories sources ts_files
       options: flags to pass to lupdate, such as -extensions to specify
       extensions for a directory scan.
       generates commands to create .ts (vie lupdate) and .qm
       (via lrelease) - files from directories and/or sources. The ts files are
       created and/or updated in the source tree (unless given with full paths).
       The qm files are generated in the build tree.
       Updating the translations can be done by adding the qm_files
       to the source list of your library/executable, so they are
       always updated, or by adding a custom target to control when
       they get updated/generated.

::

 macro QT4_ADD_TRANSLATION( qm_files ts_files ... )
       out: qm_files
       in:  ts_files
       generates commands to create .qm from .ts - files. The generated
       filenames can be found in qm_files. The ts_files
       must exist and are not updated in any way.

::

 macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... [TARGET tgt])
       The qt4_automoc macro is obsolete.  Use the CMAKE_AUTOMOC feature instead.
       This macro is still experimental.
       It can be used to have moc automatically handled.
       So if you have the files foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a
       a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc has to run on it. If you don't
       want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can insert
       #include "foo.moc"
       in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will
       scan all listed files at cmake-time for such included moc files and if it
       finds them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build time on the
       accompanying header file foo.h.
       If a source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by
       this macro.
       If the <tgt> is specified, the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and
       INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from the <tgt> are passed to moc.

::

 function QT4_USE_MODULES( target [link_type] modules...)
        This function is obsolete. Use target_link_libraries with IMPORTED targets
        instead.
        Make <target> use the <modules> from Qt. Using a Qt module means
        to link to the library, add the relevant include directories for the
        module, and add the relevant compiler defines for using the module.
        Modules are roughly equivalent to components of Qt4, so usage would be
        something like:
         qt4_use_modules(myexe Core Gui Declarative)
        to use QtCore, QtGui and QtDeclarative. The optional <link_type> argument
        can be specified as either LINK_PUBLIC or LINK_PRIVATE to specify the
        same argument to the target_link_libraries call.

IMPORTED Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A particular Qt library may be used by using the corresponding
``IMPORTED`` target with the ``target_link_libraries()``
command:

 target_link_libraries(myexe Qt4::QtGui Qt4::QtXml)

Using a target in this way causes :cmake(1)` to use the appropriate include
directories and compile definitions for the target when compiling ``myexe``.

Targets are aware of their dependencies, so for example it is not necessary
to list ``Qt4::QtCore`` if another Qt library is listed, and it is not
necessary to list ``Qt4::QtGui`` if ``Qt4::QtDeclarative`` is listed.
Targets may be tested for existence in the usual way with the
``if(TARGET)`` command.

The Qt toolkit may contain both debug and release libraries.
``cmake(1)`` will choose the appropriate version based on the build
configuration.

``Qt4::QtCore``
 The QtCore target
``Qt4::QtGui``
 The QtGui target
``Qt4::Qt3Support``

-------

Try to find M&S HLA RTI libraries

This module finds if any HLA RTI is installed and locates the standard
RTI include files and libraries.

RTI is a simulation infrastructure standardized by IEEE and SISO.  It
has a well defined C++ API that assures that simulation applications
are independent on a particular RTI implementation.

::

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-Time_Infrastructure_(simulation)

This code sets the following variables:

::

 RTI_INCLUDE_DIR = the directory where RTI includes file are found

 RTI_FOUND = Set to FALSE if any HLA RTI was not found

Report problems to <certi-devel@nongnu.org>

FindRuby
--------

Find Ruby

This module finds if Ruby is installed and determines where the
include files and libraries are.  Ruby 1.8, 1.9, 2.0 and 2.1 are
supported.

The minimum required version of Ruby can be specified using the
standard syntax, e.g.  find_package(Ruby 1.8)

It also determines what the name of the library is.  This code sets
the following variables:

``RUBY_EXECUTABLE``
  full path to the ruby binary
``RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  include dirs to be used when using the ruby library
``RUBY_LIBRARY``
  full path to the ruby library
``RUBY_VERSION``
  the version of ruby which was found, e.g. "1.8.7"
``RUBY_FOUND``
  set to true if ruby ws found successfully

Also:

``RUBY_INCLUDE_PATH``
  same as RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS, only provided for compatibility reasons, don't use it

FindSDL_image
-------------

Locate SDL_image library

This module defines:

::

 SDL_IMAGE_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
 SDL_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
 SDL_IMAGE_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
 SDL_IMAGE_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the
                            version of SDL_image

For backward compatibility the following variables are also set:

::

 SDLIMAGE_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_IMAGE_LIBRARIES)
 SDLIMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS)
 SDLIMAGE_FOUND (same value as SDL_IMAGE_FOUND)

$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.

Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).

FindSDL_mixer
-------------

Locate SDL_mixer library

This module defines:

::

 SDL_MIXER_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
 SDL_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
 SDL_MIXER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
 SDL_MIXER_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the
                            version of SDL_mixer

For backward compatibility the following variables are also set:

::

 SDLMIXER_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_MIXER_LIBRARIES)
 SDLMIXER_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIRS)
 SDLMIXER_FOUND (same value as SDL_MIXER_FOUND)

$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.

Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).

FindSDL_net
-----------

Locate SDL_net library

This module defines:

::

 SDL_NET_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
 SDL_NET_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
 SDL_NET_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
 SDL_NET_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the version of SDL_net

For backward compatibility the following variables are also set:

::

 SDLNET_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_NET_LIBRARIES)
 SDLNET_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_NET_INCLUDE_DIRS)
 SDLNET_FOUND (same value as SDL_NET_FOUND)

$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.

Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).

FindSDL
-------

Locate SDL library

This module defines

::

 SDL_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
 SDL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
 SDL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h
 SDL_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the version of SDL

This module responds to the flag:

::

 SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY
   If this is defined, then no SDL_main will be linked in because
   only applications need main().
   Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this
   module will attempt to locate and set the proper link flags
   as part of the returned SDL_LIBRARY variable.

Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the
OS X framework based version.  (Other versions link to -lSDLmain which
this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.



Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your
configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL
library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc).  Set
SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL library, and configure again.
Similarly, if you see an empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this
value as appropriate.  These values are used to generate the final
SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset, SDL_LIBRARY
does not get created.



$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.  l.e.galup 9-20-02

Modified by Eric Wing.  Added code to assist with automated building
by using environmental variables and providing a more
controlled/consistent search behavior.  Added new modifications to
recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL
guidelines.  Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some
platforms.  Added a search for threads which is needed by some
platforms.  Added needed compile switches for MinGW.

On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to
override this selection or set the CMake environment
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.

Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include
"SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>.  This is done for portability reasons
because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).

FindSDL_sound
-------------

Locates the SDL_sound library



This module depends on SDL being found and must be called AFTER
FindSDL.cmake is called.

This module defines

::

 SDL_SOUND_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL_sound.h
 SDL_SOUND_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL_sound
 SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES, this contains the list of libraries that you need
   to link against.
 SDL_SOUND_EXTRAS, this is an optional variable for you to add your own
   flags to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES. This is prepended to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES.
   This is available mostly for cases this module failed to anticipate for
   and you must add additional flags. This is marked as ADVANCED.
 SDL_SOUND_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the
   version of SDL_sound

This module also defines (but you shouldn't need to use directly)

::

 SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY, the name of just the SDL_sound library you would link
 against. Use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES for you link instructions and not this one.

And might define the following as needed

::

 MIKMOD_LIBRARY
 MODPLUG_LIBRARY
 OGG_LIBRARY
 VORBIS_LIBRARY
 SMPEG_LIBRARY
 FLAC_LIBRARY
 SPEEX_LIBRARY

Typically, you should not use these variables directly, and you should
use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES which contains SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY and the other
audio libraries (if needed) to successfully compile on your system.

Created by Eric Wing.  This module is a bit more complicated than the
other FindSDL* family modules.  The reason is that SDL_sound can be
compiled in a large variety of different ways which are independent of
platform.  SDL_sound may dynamically link against other 3rd party
libraries to get additional codec support, such as Ogg Vorbis, SMPEG,
ModPlug, MikMod, FLAC, Speex, and potentially others.  Under some
circumstances which I don't fully understand, there seems to be a
requirement that dependent libraries of libraries you use must also be
explicitly linked against in order to successfully compile.  SDL_sound
does not currently have any system in place to know how it was
compiled.  So this CMake module does the hard work in trying to
discover which 3rd party libraries are required for building (if any).
This module uses a brute force approach to create a test program that
uses SDL_sound, and then tries to build it.  If the build fails, it
parses the error output for known symbol names to figure out which
libraries are needed.

Responds to the $SDLDIR and $SDLSOUNDDIR environmental variable that
would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building
SDL.

On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to
override this selectionor set the CMake environment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
to modify the search paths.

FindSDL_ttf
-----------

Locate SDL_ttf library

This module defines:

::

 SDL_TTF_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
 SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
 SDL_TTF_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
 SDL_TTF_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the version of SDL_ttf

For backward compatibility the following variables are also set:

::

 SDLTTF_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_TTF_LIBRARIES)
 SDLTTF_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS)
 SDLTTF_FOUND (same value as SDL_TTF_FOUND)

$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.

Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).

FindSelfPackers
---------------

Find upx

This module looks for some executable packers (i.e.  software that
compress executables or shared libs into on-the-fly self-extracting
executables or shared libs.  Examples:

::

 UPX: http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html

FindSquish
----------

-- Typical Use



This module can be used to find Squish.  Currently Squish versions 3
and 4 are supported.

::

 SQUISH_FOUND                    If false, don't try to use Squish
 SQUISH_VERSION                  The full version of Squish found
 SQUISH_VERSION_MAJOR            The major version of Squish found
 SQUISH_VERSION_MINOR            The minor version of Squish found
 SQUISH_VERSION_PATCH            The patch version of Squish found

::

 SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR              The Squish installation directory
                                 (containing bin, lib, etc)
 SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE        The squishserver executable
 SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE        The squishrunner executable

::

 SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR_FOUND        Was the install directory found?
 SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE_FOUND  Was the server executable found?
 SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE_FOUND  Was the client executable found?

It provides the function squish_v4_add_test() for adding a squish test
to cmake using Squish 4.x:

::

 squish_v4_add_test(cmakeTestName
   AUT targetName SUITE suiteName TEST squishTestName
   [SETTINGSGROUP group] [PRE_COMMAND command] [POST_COMMAND command] )

The arguments have the following meaning:

``cmakeTestName``
  this will be used as the first argument for add_test()
``AUT targetName``
  the name of the cmake target which will be used as AUT, i.e. the
  executable which will be tested.
``SUITE suiteName``
  this is either the full path to the squish suite, or just the
  last directory of the suite, i.e. the suite name. In this case
  the CMakeLists.txt which calls squish_add_test() must be located
  in the parent directory of the suite directory.
``TEST squishTestName``
  the name of the squish test, i.e. the name of the subdirectory
  of the test inside the suite directory.
``SETTINGSGROUP group``
  if specified, the given settings group will be used for executing the test.
  If not specified, the groupname will be "CTest_<username>"
``PRE_COMMAND command``
  if specified, the given command will be executed before starting the squish test.
``POST_COMMAND command``
  same as PRE_COMMAND, but after the squish test has been executed.



::

 enable_testing()
 find_package(Squish 4.0)
 if (SQUISH_FOUND)
    squish_v4_add_test(myTestName
      AUT myApp
      SUITE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/tests/mySuite
      TEST someSquishTest
      SETTINGSGROUP myGroup
      )
 endif ()

For users of Squish version 3.x the macro squish_v3_add_test() is
provided:

::

 squish_v3_add_test(testName applicationUnderTest testCase envVars testWrapper)
 Use this macro to add a test using Squish 3.x.

::

 enable_testing()
 find_package(Squish)
 if (SQUISH_FOUND)
   squish_v3_add_test(myTestName myApplication testCase envVars testWrapper)
 endif ()

macro SQUISH_ADD_TEST(testName applicationUnderTest testCase envVars
testWrapper)

::

 This is deprecated. Use SQUISH_V3_ADD_TEST() if you are using Squish 3.x instead.

FindSQLite3
-----------

Find the SQLite libraries, v3

IMPORTED targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` target:

``SQLite::SQLite3``

Result variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables if found:

``SQLite3_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  where to find sqlite3.h, etc.
``SQLite3_LIBRARIES``
  the libraries to link against to use SQLite3.
``SQLite3_VERSION``
  version of the SQLite3 library found
``SQLite3_FOUND``
  TRUE if found


FindSubversion
--------------

Extract information from a subversion working copy

The module defines the following variables:

::

 Subversion_SVN_EXECUTABLE - path to svn command line client
 Subversion_VERSION_SVN - version of svn command line client
 Subversion_FOUND - true if the command line client was found
 SUBVERSION_FOUND - same as Subversion_FOUND, set for compatibility reasons

The minimum required version of Subversion can be specified using the
standard syntax, e.g. ``find_package(Subversion 1.4)``.

If the command line client executable is found two macros are defined:

::

 Subversion_WC_INFO(<dir> <var-prefix> [IGNORE_SVN_FAILURE])
 Subversion_WC_LOG(<dir> <var-prefix>)

``Subversion_WC_INFO`` extracts information of a subversion working copy at a
given location.  This macro defines the following variables if running
Subversion's ``info`` command on ``<dir>`` succeeds; otherwise a
``SEND_ERROR`` message is generated. The error can be ignored by providing the
``IGNORE_SVN_FAILURE`` option, which causes these variables to remain
undefined.

::

 <var-prefix>_WC_URL - url of the repository (at <dir>)
 <var-prefix>_WC_ROOT - root url of the repository
 <var-prefix>_WC_REVISION - current revision
 <var-prefix>_WC_LAST_CHANGED_AUTHOR - author of last commit
 <var-prefix>_WC_LAST_CHANGED_DATE - date of last commit
 <var-prefix>_WC_LAST_CHANGED_REV - revision of last commit
 <var-prefix>_WC_INFO - output of command `svn info <dir>'

``Subversion_WC_LOG`` retrieves the log message of the base revision of a
subversion working copy at a given location.  This macro defines the variable:

::

 <var-prefix>_LAST_CHANGED_LOG - last log of base revision

Example usage:

::

 find_package(Subversion)
 if(SUBVERSION_FOUND)
   Subversion_WC_INFO(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
   message("Current revision is ${Project_WC_REVISION}")
   Subversion_WC_LOG(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
   message("Last changed log is ${Project_LAST_CHANGED_LOG}")
 endif()

FindSWIG
--------

Find SWIG

This module finds an installed SWIG.  It sets the following variables:

::

 SWIG_FOUND - set to true if SWIG is found
 SWIG_DIR - the directory where swig is installed
 SWIG_EXECUTABLE - the path to the swig executable
 SWIG_VERSION   - the version number of the swig executable

The minimum required version of SWIG can be specified using the
standard syntax, e.g.  find_package(SWIG 1.1)

All information is collected from the SWIG_EXECUTABLE so the version
to be found can be changed from the command line by means of setting
SWIG_EXECUTABLE

FindTCL
-------

TK_INTERNAL_PATH was removed.

This module finds if Tcl is installed and determines where the include
files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of the
library is.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 TCL_FOUND              = Tcl was found
 TK_FOUND               = Tk was found
 TCLTK_FOUND            = Tcl and Tk were found
 TCL_LIBRARY            = path to Tcl library (tcl tcl80)
 TCL_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where tcl.h can be found
 TCL_TCLSH              = path to tclsh binary (tcl tcl80)
 TK_LIBRARY             = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)
 TK_INCLUDE_PATH        = path to where tk.h can be found
 TK_WISH                = full path to the wish executable

In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for
people who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk gurus/developers, some
variables were moved or removed.  Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:

::

 => they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk extensions.
 => these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions.
    Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs
    are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one
    specifically (say, amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx).
    Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign
    TCL_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.
 => this ended up being only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of
    confusion regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk
    tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal path at
    this point it is safer you ask directly where the *source* tree is
    and dig from there.

FindTclsh
---------

Find tclsh

This module finds if TCL is installed and determines where the include
files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of the
library is.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 TCLSH_FOUND = TRUE if tclsh has been found
 TCL_TCLSH = the path to the tclsh executable

In cygwin, look for the cygwin version first.  Don't look for it later
to avoid finding the cygwin version on a Win32 build.

FindTclStub
-----------

TCL_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG and TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.

This module finds Tcl stub libraries.  It first finds Tcl include
files and libraries by calling FindTCL.cmake.  How to Use the Tcl
Stubs Library:

::

 http://tcl.activestate.com/doc/howto/stubs.html

Using Stub Libraries:

::

 http://safari.oreilly.com/0130385603/ch48lev1sec3

This code sets the following variables:

::

 TCL_STUB_LIBRARY       = path to Tcl stub library
 TK_STUB_LIBRARY        = path to Tk stub library
 TTK_STUB_LIBRARY       = path to ttk stub library

In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for
people who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk gurus/developers, some
variables were moved or removed.  Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:

::

 => these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions.
    Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs
    are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one
    specifically (say, amongst tclstub84g, tclstub84gs, or tclstub84sgx).
    Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign
    TCL_STUB_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.

FindThreads
-----------

This module determines the thread library of the system.

The following variables are set

::

 CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT     - the thread library
 CMAKE_USE_WIN32_THREADS_INIT - using WIN32 threads?
 CMAKE_USE_PTHREADS_INIT    - are we using pthreads
 CMAKE_HP_PTHREADS_INIT     - are we using hp pthreads

The following import target is created

::

 Threads::Threads

If the use of the -pthread compiler and linker flag is preferred then the
caller can set

::

 THREADS_PREFER_PTHREAD_FLAG

The compiler flag can only be used with the imported
target. Use of both the imported target as well as this switch is highly
recommended for new code.

This module is not needed for C++11 and later if threading is done using
``std::thread`` from the standard library.

FindTIFF
--------

Find the TIFF library (libtiff).

Imported targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` targets:

``TIFF::TIFF``
  The TIFF library, if found.

Result variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables in your project:

``TIFF_FOUND``
  true if the TIFF headers and libraries were found
``TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR``
  the directory containing the TIFF headers
``TIFF_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  the directory containing the TIFF headers
``TIFF_LIBRARIES``
  TIFF libraries to be linked

Cache variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following cache variables may also be set:

``TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR``
  the directory containing the TIFF headers
``TIFF_LIBRARY``
  the path to the TIFF library

FindUnixCommands
----------------

Find Unix commands, including the ones from Cygwin

This module looks for the Unix commands bash, cp, gzip, mv, rm, and tar
and stores the result in the variables BASH, CP, GZIP, MV, RM, and TAR.

FindVTK
-------

This module no longer exists.

This module existed in versions of CMake prior to 3.1, but became
only a thin wrapper around ``find_package(VTK NO_MODULE)`` to
provide compatibility for projects using long-outdated conventions.
Now ``find_package(VTK)`` will search for ``VTKConfig.cmake``
directly.

FindVulkan
----------

Try to find Vulkan

IMPORTED Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines ``IMPORTED`` target ``Vulkan::Vulkan``, if
Vulkan has been found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following variables::

 Vulkan_FOUND          - True if Vulkan was found
 Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIRS   - include directories for Vulkan
 Vulkan_LIBRARIES      - link against this library to use Vulkan

The module will also define two cache variables::

 Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIR    - the Vulkan include directory
 Vulkan_LIBRARY        - the path to the Vulkan library

FindWget
--------

Find wget

This module looks for wget.  This module defines the following values:

::

 WGET_EXECUTABLE: the full path to the wget tool.
 WGET_FOUND: True if wget has been found.

FindWish
--------

Find wish installation

This module finds if TCL is installed and determines where the include
files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of the
library is.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 TK_WISH = the path to the wish executable

if UNIX is defined, then it will look for the cygwin version first

FindwxWidgets
-------------

Find a wxWidgets (a.k.a., wxWindows) installation.

This module finds if wxWidgets is installed and selects a default
configuration to use.  wxWidgets is a modular library.  To specify the
modules that you will use, you need to name them as components to the
package:

find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS core base ... OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS net ...)

There are two search branches: a windows style and a unix style.  For
windows, the following variables are searched for and set to defaults
in case of multiple choices.  Change them if the defaults are not
desired (i.e., these are the only variables you should change to
select a configuration):

::

 wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR      - Base wxWidgets directory
                           (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3).
 wxWidgets_LIB_DIR       - Path to wxWidgets libraries
                           (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3/lib/vc_lib).
 wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION - Configuration to use
                           (e.g., msw, mswd, mswu, mswunivud, etc.)
 wxWidgets_EXCLUDE_COMMON_LIBRARIES
                         - Set to TRUE to exclude linking of
                           commonly required libs (e.g., png tiff
                           jpeg zlib regex expat).

For unix style it uses the wx-config utility.  You can select between
debug/release, unicode/ansi, universal/non-universal, and
static/shared in the QtDialog or ccmake interfaces by turning ON/OFF
the following variables:

::

 wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG
 wxWidgets_USE_UNICODE
 wxWidgets_USE_UNIVERSAL
 wxWidgets_USE_STATIC

There is also a wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS variable for all other
options that need to be passed to the wx-config utility.  For example,
to use the base toolkit found in the /usr/local path, set the variable
(before calling the FIND_PACKAGE command) as such:

::

 set(wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS --toolkit=base --prefix=/usr)

The following are set after the configuration is done for both windows
and unix style:

::

 wxWidgets_FOUND            - Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.
 wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS     - Include directories for WIN32
                              i.e., where to find "wx/wx.h" and
                              "wx/setup.h"; possibly empty for unices.
 wxWidgets_LIBRARIES        - Path to the wxWidgets libraries.
 wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS     - compile time link dirs, useful for
                              rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string
                              in WIN32 environment.
 wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS      - Contains defines required to compile/link
                              against WX, e.g. WXUSINGDLL
 wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG- Contains defines required to compile/link
                              against WX debug builds, e.g. __WXDEBUG__
 wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS        - Include dirs and compiler flags for
                              unices, empty on WIN32. Essentially
                              "`wx-config --cxxflags`".
 wxWidgets_USE_FILE         - Convenience include file.

Sample usage:

::

 # Note that for MinGW users the order of libs is important!
 find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS gl core base OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS net)
 if(wxWidgets_FOUND)
   include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
   # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
   target_link_libraries(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})
 endif()

If wxWidgets is required (i.e., not an optional part):

::

 find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED gl core base OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS net)
 include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
 # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
 target_link_libraries(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})

Deprecated Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deprecated Utility Modules
==========================

CMakeDetermineVSServicePack
---------------------------

The functionality of this module has been superseded by the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION`` variable that contains
the compiler version number.

Determine the Visual Studio service pack of the 'cl' in use.

Usage::

 if(MSVC)
   include(CMakeDetermineVSServicePack)
   DetermineVSServicePack( my_service_pack )
   if( my_service_pack )
     message(STATUS "Detected: ${my_service_pack}")
   endif()
 endif()

Function DetermineVSServicePack sets the given variable to one of the
following values or an empty string if unknown::

 vc80, vc80sp1
 vc90, vc90sp1
 vc100, vc100sp1
 vc110, vc110sp1, vc110sp2, vc110sp3, vc110sp4

CMakeExpandImportedTargets
--------------------------

This module was once needed to expand imported targets to the underlying
libraries they reference on disk for use with the ``try_compile()``
and ``try_run()`` commands.  These commands now support imported
libraries in their ``LINK_LIBRARIES`` options (since CMake 2.8.11
for ``try_compile()`` and since CMake 3.2 for ``try_run()``).

This module does not support the policy ``CMP0022`` ``NEW``
behavior or use of the ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` property
because ``generator expressions``
cannot be evaluated during configuration.

::

 CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS(<var> LIBRARIES lib1 lib2...libN
                               [CONFIGURATION <config>])

CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS() takes a list of libraries and replaces
all imported targets contained in this list with their actual file
paths of the referenced libraries on disk, including the libraries
from their link interfaces.  If a CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the
respective configuration of the imported targets if it exists.  If no
CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the first configuration from
${CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES} if set, otherwise ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}.

::

 cmake_expand_imported_targets(expandedLibs
   LIBRARIES ${CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES}
   CONFIGURATION "${CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION}" )

CMakeForceCompiler
------------------

The macros provided by this module were once intended for use by
cross-compiling toolchain files when CMake was not able to automatically
detect the compiler identification.  Since the introduction of this module,
CMake's compiler identification capabilities have improved and can now be
taught to recognize any compiler.  Furthermore, the suite of information
CMake detects from a compiler is now too extensive to be provided by
toolchain files using these macros.

One common use case for this module was to skip CMake's checks for a
working compiler when using a cross-compiler that cannot link binaries
without special flags or custom linker scripts.  This case is now supported
by setting the ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE`` variable in the
toolchain file instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Macro CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER has the following signature:

::

 CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler-id>)

It sets CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake internal
variable CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler-id.  It also
bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information
tests.

Macro CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER has the following signature:

::

 CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler-id>)

It sets CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake
internal variable CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler-id.  It
also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler
information tests.

Macro CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER has the following signature:

::

 CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler-id>)

It sets CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake
internal variable CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler-id.
It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler
information tests.

So a simple toolchain file could look like this:

::

 include (CMakeForceCompiler)
 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic)
 CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER   (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
 CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)

CMakeParseArguments
-------------------

This module once implemented the ``cmake_parse_arguments()`` command
that is now implemented natively by CMake.  It is now an empty placeholder
for compatibility with projects that include it to get the command from
CMake 3.4 and lower.

MacroAddFileDependencies
------------------------

MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<_file> depend_files...)

Using the macro MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES() is discouraged.  There
are usually better ways to specify the correct dependencies.

MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<_file> depend_files...) is just a
convenience wrapper around the OBJECT_DEPENDS source file property.
You can just use set_property(SOURCE <file> APPEND PROPERTY
OBJECT_DEPENDS depend_files) instead.

TestCXXAcceptsFlag
------------------

Check if the CXX compiler accepts a flag.

 CHECK_CXX_ACCEPTS_FLAG(<flags> <variable>)

``<flags>``
 the flags to try
``<variable>``
 variable to store the result

UsePkgConfig
------------

Obsolete pkg-config module for CMake, use FindPkgConfig instead.



This module defines the following macro:

PKGCONFIG(package includedir libdir linkflags cflags)

Calling PKGCONFIG will fill the desired information into the 4 given
arguments, e.g.  PKGCONFIG(libart-2.0 LIBART_INCLUDE_DIR
LIBART_LINK_DIR LIBART_LINK_FLAGS LIBART_CFLAGS) if pkg-config was NOT
found or the specified software package doesn't exist, the variable
will be empty when the function returns, otherwise they will contain
the respective information

Use_wxWindows
-------------

This convenience include finds if wxWindows is installed and set the
appropriate libs, incdirs, flags etc.  author Jan Woetzel <jw -at-
mip.informatik.uni-kiel.de> (07/2003)

USAGE:

::

 just include Use_wxWindows.cmake
 in your projects CMakeLists.txt

include( ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}/Use_wxWindows.cmake)

::

 if you are sure you need GL then

set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)

::

 *before* you include this file.

WriteBasicConfigVersionFile
---------------------------

::

 WRITE_BASIC_CONFIG_VERSION_FILE( filename
   [VERSION major.minor.patch]
   COMPATIBILITY (AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|SameMinorVersion|ExactVersion)
   [ARCH_INDEPENDENT]
   )

Deprecated Find Modules
=======================

FindCUDA
--------

Replacement
^^^^^^^^^^^

It is no longer necessary to use this module or call ``find_package(CUDA)``.
Instead, list ``CUDA`` among the languages named in the top-level
call to the ``project()`` command, or call the
``enable_language()`` command with ``CUDA``.
Then one can add CUDA (``.cu``) sources to programs directly
in calls to ``add_library()`` and ``add_executable()``.

Documentation of Deprecated Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tools for building CUDA C files: libraries and build dependencies.

This script locates the NVIDIA CUDA C tools.  It should work on Linux,
Windows, and macOS and should be reasonably up to date with CUDA C
releases.

This script makes use of the standard ``find_package()`` arguments of
``<VERSION>``, ``REQUIRED`` and ``QUIET``.  ``CUDA_FOUND`` will report if an
acceptable version of CUDA was found.

The script will prompt the user to specify ``CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR`` if
the prefix cannot be determined by the location of nvcc in the system
path and ``REQUIRED`` is specified to ``find_package()``.  To use
a different installed version of the toolkit set the environment variable
``CUDA_BIN_PATH`` before running cmake (e.g.
``CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0`` instead of the default
``/usr/local/cuda``) or set ``CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR`` after configuring.  If
you change the value of ``CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR``, various components that
depend on the path will be relocated.

It might be necessary to set ``CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR`` manually on certain
platforms, or to use a CUDA runtime not installed in the default
location.  In newer versions of the toolkit the CUDA library is
included with the graphics driver -- be sure that the driver version
matches what is needed by the CUDA runtime version.

The following variables affect the behavior of the macros in the
script (in alphabetical order).  Note that any of these flags can be
changed multiple times in the same directory before calling
``CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE``, ``CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY``, ``CUDA_COMPILE``,
``CUDA_COMPILE_PTX``, ``CUDA_COMPILE_FATBIN``, ``CUDA_COMPILE_CUBIN``
or ``CUDA_WRAP_SRCS``::

 CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE (Default matches host bit size)
 -- Set to ON to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32 bit device code.
    Note that making this different from the host code when generating object
    or C files from CUDA code just won't work, because size_t gets defined by
    nvcc in the generated source.  If you compile to PTX and then load the
    file yourself, you can mix bit sizes between device and host.

 CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE (Default ON)
 -- Set to ON if you want the custom build rule to be attached to the source
    file in Visual Studio.  Turn OFF if you add the same cuda file to multiple
    targets.

    This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA file; however, bad
    things can happen if the CUDA source file is added to multiple targets.
    When performing parallel builds it is possible for the custom build
    command to be run more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build
    errors.  VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a
    source can have only one rule no matter how many projects it is added to.
    When the rule is run from multiple targets race conditions can occur on
    the generated file.  Eventually everything will get built, but if the user
    is unaware of this behavior, there may be confusion.  It would be nice if
    this script could detect the reuse of source files across multiple targets
    and turn the option off for the user, but no good solution could be found.

 CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN (Default OFF)
 -- Set to ON to enable and extra compilation pass with the -cubin option in
    Device mode. The output is parsed and register, shared memory usage is
    printed during build.

 CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION (Default OFF for device mode)
 -- Set to ON for Emulation mode. -D_DEVICEEMU is defined for CUDA C files
    when CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION is TRUE.

 CUDA_LINK_LIBRARIES_KEYWORD (Default "")
  -- The <PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> keyword to use for internal
     target_link_libraries calls. The default is to use no keyword which
     uses the old "plain" form of target_link_libraries. Note that is matters
     because whatever is used inside the FindCUDA module must also be used
     outside - the two forms of target_link_libraries cannot be mixed.

 CUDA_GENERATED_OUTPUT_DIR (Default CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR)
 -- Set to the path you wish to have the generated files placed.  If it is
    blank output files will be placed in CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR.
    Intermediate files will always be placed in
    CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/CMakeFiles.

 CUDA_HOST_COMPILATION_CPP (Default ON)
 -- Set to OFF for C compilation of host code.

 CUDA_HOST_COMPILER (Default CMAKE_C_COMPILER)
 -- Set the host compiler to be used by nvcc.  Ignored if -ccbin or
    --compiler-bindir is already present in the CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or
    CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_<CONFIG> variables.  For Visual Studio targets,
    the host compiler is constructed with one or more visual studio macros
    such as $(VCInstallDir), that expands out to the path when
    the command is run from within VS.
    If the CUDAHOSTCXX environment variable is set it will
    be used as the default.

 CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS
 CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
 -- Additional NVCC command line arguments.  NOTE: multiple arguments must be
    semi-colon delimited (e.g. --compiler-options;-Wall)

 CUDA_PROPAGATE_HOST_FLAGS (Default ON)
 -- Set to ON to propagate CMAKE_{C,CXX}_FLAGS and their configuration
    dependent counterparts (e.g. CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG) automatically to the
    host compiler through nvcc's -Xcompiler flag.  This helps make the
    generated host code match the rest of the system better.  Sometimes
    certain flags give nvcc problems, and this will help you turn the flag
    propagation off.  This does not affect the flags supplied directly to nvcc
    via CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or through the OPTION flags specified through
    CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.  Flags used for
    shared library compilation are not affected by this flag.

 CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION (Default OFF)
 -- If set this will enable separable compilation for all CUDA runtime object
    files.  If used outside of CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY
    (e.g. calling CUDA_WRAP_SRCS directly),
    CUDA_COMPUTE_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECT_FILE_NAME and
    CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS should be called.

 CUDA_SOURCE_PROPERTY_FORMAT
 -- If this source file property is set, it can override the format specified
    to CUDA_WRAP_SRCS (OBJ, PTX, CUBIN, or FATBIN).  If an input source file
    is not a .cu file, setting this file will cause it to be treated as a .cu
    file. See documentation for set_source_files_properties on how to set
    this property.

 CUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME (Default ON)
 -- When enabled the static version of the CUDA runtime library will be used
    in CUDA_LIBRARIES.  If the version of CUDA configured doesn't support
    this option, then it will be silently disabled.

 CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD (Default OFF)
 -- Set to ON to see all the commands used when building the CUDA file.  When
    using a Makefile generator the value defaults to VERBOSE (run make
    VERBOSE=1 to see output), although setting CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD to ON will
    always print the output.

The script creates the following macros (in alphabetical order)::

 CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
 -- Adds the cufft library to the target (can be any target).  Handles whether
    you are in emulation mode or not.

 CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
 -- Adds the cublas library to the target (can be any target).  Handles
    whether you are in emulation mode or not.

 CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                      [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Creates an executable "cuda_target" which is made up of the files
    specified.  All of the non CUDA C files are compiled using the standard
    build rules specified by CMAKE and the cuda files are compiled to object
    files using nvcc and the host compiler.  In addition CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS is
    added automatically to include_directories().  Some standard CMake target
    calls can be used on the target after calling this macro
    (e.g. set_target_properties and target_link_libraries), but setting
    properties that adjust compilation flags will not affect code compiled by
    nvcc.  Such flags should be modified before calling CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
    CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.

 CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                   [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Same as CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE except that a library is created.

 CUDA_BUILD_CLEAN_TARGET()
 -- Creates a convenience target that deletes all the dependency files
    generated.  You should make clean after running this target to ensure the
    dependency files get regenerated.

 CUDA_COMPILE( generated_files file0 file1 ... [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
               [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Returns a list of generated files from the input source files to be used
    with ADD_LIBRARY or ADD_EXECUTABLE.

 CUDA_COMPILE_PTX( generated_files file0 file1 ... [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Returns a list of PTX files generated from the input source files.

 CUDA_COMPILE_FATBIN( generated_files file0 file1 ... [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Returns a list of FATBIN files generated from the input source files.

 CUDA_COMPILE_CUBIN( generated_files file0 file1 ... [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Returns a list of CUBIN files generated from the input source files.

 CUDA_COMPUTE_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECT_FILE_NAME( output_file_var
                                                      cuda_target
                                                      object_files )
 -- Compute the name of the intermediate link file used for separable
    compilation.  This file name is typically passed into
    CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS.  output_file_var is produced
    based on cuda_target the list of objects files that need separable
    compilation as specified by object_files.  If the object_files list is
    empty, then output_file_var will be empty.  This function is called
    automatically for CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY and CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE.  Note that
    this is a function and not a macro.

 CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( path0 path1 ... )
 -- Sets the directories that should be passed to nvcc
    (e.g. nvcc -Ipath0 -Ipath1 ... ). These paths usually contain other .cu
    files.


 CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS( output_file_var cuda_target
                                          nvcc_flags object_files)
 -- Generates the link object required by separable compilation from the given
    object files.  This is called automatically for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and
    CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, but can be called manually when using CUDA_WRAP_SRCS
    directly.  When called from CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE the
    nvcc_flags passed in are the same as the flags passed in via the OPTIONS
    argument.  The only nvcc flag added automatically is the bitness flag as
    specified by CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE.  Note that this is a function
    instead of a macro.

 CUDA_SELECT_NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS(out_variable [target_CUDA_architectures])
 -- Selects GPU arch flags for nvcc based on target_CUDA_architectures
    target_CUDA_architectures : Auto | Common | All | LIST(ARCH_AND_PTX ...)
     - "Auto" detects local machine GPU compute arch at runtime.
     - "Common" and "All" cover common and entire subsets of architectures
    ARCH_AND_PTX : NAME | NUM.NUM | NUM.NUM(NUM.NUM) | NUM.NUM+PTX
    NAME: Fermi Kepler Maxwell Kepler+Tegra Kepler+Tesla Maxwell+Tegra Pascal
    NUM: Any number. Only those pairs are currently accepted by NVCC though:
          2.0 2.1 3.0 3.2 3.5 3.7 5.0 5.2 5.3 6.0 6.2
    Returns LIST of flags to be added to CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS in ${out_variable}
    Additionally, sets ${out_variable}_readable to the resulting numeric list
    Example:
     CUDA_SELECT_NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS(ARCH_FLAGS 3.0 3.5+PTX 5.2(5.0) Maxwell)
      LIST(APPEND CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS ${ARCH_FLAGS})

    More info on CUDA architectures: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA
    Note that this is a function instead of a macro.

 CUDA_WRAP_SRCS ( cuda_target format generated_files file0 file1 ...
                  [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- This is where all the magic happens.  CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
    CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, and CUDA_COMPILE_PTX all call this
    function under the hood.

    Given the list of files (file0 file1 ... fileN) this macro generates
    custom commands that generate either PTX or linkable objects (use "PTX" or
    "OBJ" for the format argument to switch).  Files that don't end with .cu
    or have the HEADER_FILE_ONLY property are ignored.

    The arguments passed in after OPTIONS are extra command line options to
    give to nvcc.  You can also specify per configuration options by
    specifying the name of the configuration followed by the options.  General
    options must precede configuration specific options.  Not all
    configurations need to be specified, only the ones provided will be used.

       OPTIONS -DFLAG=2 "-DFLAG_OTHER=space in flag"
       DEBUG -g
       RELEASE --use_fast_math
       RELWITHDEBINFO --use_fast_math;-g
       MINSIZEREL --use_fast_math

    For certain configurations (namely VS generating object files with
    CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE set to ON), no generated file will
    be produced for the given cuda file.  This is because when you add the
    cuda file to Visual Studio it knows that this file produces an object file
    and will link in the resulting object file automatically.

    This script will also generate a separate cmake script that is used at
    build time to invoke nvcc.  This is for several reasons.

      1. nvcc can return negative numbers as return values which confuses
      Visual Studio into thinking that the command succeeded.  The script now
      checks the error codes and produces errors when there was a problem.

      2. nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results when it
      encounters problems.  This confuses build systems into thinking the
      target was generated when in fact an unusable file exists.  The script
      now deletes the output files if there was an error.

      3. By putting all the options that affect the build into a file and then
      make the build rule dependent on the file, the output files will be
      regenerated when the options change.

    This script also looks at optional arguments STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE to
    determine when to target the object compilation for a shared library.
    BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is ignored in CUDA_WRAP_SRCS, but it is respected in
    CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.  On some systems special flags are added for building
    objects intended for shared libraries.  A preprocessor macro,
    <target_name>_EXPORTS is defined when a shared library compilation is
    detected.

    Flags passed into add_definitions with -D or /D are passed along to nvcc.

The script defines the following variables::

 CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR    -- The major version of cuda as reported by nvcc.
 CUDA_VERSION_MINOR    -- The minor version.
 CUDA_VERSION
 CUDA_VERSION_STRING   -- CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR.CUDA_VERSION_MINOR
 CUDA_HAS_FP16         -- Whether a short float (float16,fp16) is supported.

 CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR -- Path to the CUDA Toolkit (defined if not set).
 CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR     -- Path to the CUDA SDK.  Use this to find files in the
                          SDK.  This script will not directly support finding
                          specific libraries or headers, as that isn't
                          supported by NVIDIA.  If you want to change
                          libraries when the path changes see the
                          FindCUDA.cmake script for an example of how to clear
                          these variables.  There are also examples of how to
                          use the CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR to locate headers or
                          libraries, if you so choose (at your own risk).
 CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS     -- Include directory for cuda headers.  Added automatically
                          for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.
 CUDA_LIBRARIES        -- Cuda RT library.

FindPythonInterp
----------------

Find python interpreter

This module finds if Python interpreter is installed and determines
where the executables are.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 PYTHONINTERP_FOUND         - Was the Python executable found
 PYTHON_EXECUTABLE          - path to the Python interpreter

::

 PYTHON_VERSION_STRING      - Python version found e.g. 2.5.2
 PYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR       - Python major version found e.g. 2
 PYTHON_VERSION_MINOR       - Python minor version found e.g. 5
 PYTHON_VERSION_PATCH       - Python patch version found e.g. 2

The Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to specify a list
of version numbers that should be taken into account when searching
for Python.  You need to set this variable before calling
find_package(PythonInterp).

If calling both ``find_package(PythonInterp)`` and
``find_package(PythonLibs)``, call ``find_package(PythonInterp)`` first to
get the currently active Python version by default with a consistent version
of PYTHON_LIBRARIES.

FindPythonLibs
--------------

Find python libraries

This module finds if Python is installed and determines where the
include files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of
the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 PYTHONLIBS_FOUND           - have the Python libs been found
 PYTHON_LIBRARIES           - path to the python library
 PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH        - path to where Python.h is found (deprecated)
 PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS        - path to where Python.h is found
 PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARIES     - path to the debug library (deprecated)
 PYTHONLIBS_VERSION_STRING  - version of the Python libs found (since CMake 2.8.8)

The Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to specify a list
of version numbers that should be taken into account when searching
for Python.  You need to set this variable before calling
find_package(PythonLibs).

If you'd like to specify the installation of Python to use, you should
modify the following cache variables:

::

 PYTHON_LIBRARY             - path to the python library
 PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR         - path to where Python.h is found

If calling both ``find_package(PythonInterp)`` and
``find_package(PythonLibs)``, call ``find_package(PythonInterp)`` first to
get the currently active Python version by default with a consistent version
of PYTHON_LIBRARIES.

FindQt
------

Searches for all installed versions of Qt3 or Qt4.

This module cannot handle Qt5 or any later versions.
For those, see ``cmake-qt(7)``.

This module exists for the ``find_package()`` command only if
policy ``CMP0084`` is not set to ``NEW``.

This module should only be used if your project can work with multiple
versions of Qt.  If not, you should just directly use FindQt4 or
FindQt3.  If multiple versions of Qt are found on the machine, then
The user must set the option DESIRED_QT_VERSION to the version they
want to use.  If only one version of qt is found on the machine, then
the DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to that version and the matching FindQt3
or FindQt4 module is included.  Once the user sets DESIRED_QT_VERSION,
then the FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included.

::

 QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can
             not find Qt4 or Qt3 an error is raised
             and a message is sent to the user.

::

 DESIRED_QT_VERSION OPTION is created
 QT4_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt4 is found.
 QT3_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt3 is found.

FindwxWindows
-------------

Find wxWindows (wxWidgets) installation

This module finds if wxWindows/wxWidgets is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are.  It also determines what
the name of the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 WXWINDOWS_FOUND     = system has WxWindows
 WXWINDOWS_LIBRARIES = path to the wxWindows libraries
                       on Unix/Linux with additional
                       linker flags from
                       "wx-config --libs"
 CMAKE_WXWINDOWS_CXX_FLAGS  = Compiler flags for wxWindows,
                              essentially "`wx-config --cxxflags`"
                              on Linux
 WXWINDOWS_INCLUDE_DIR      = where to find "wx/wx.h" and "wx/setup.h"
 WXWINDOWS_LINK_DIRECTORIES = link directories, useful for rpath on
                               Unix
 WXWINDOWS_DEFINITIONS      = extra defines

OPTIONS If you need OpenGL support please

::

 set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)

in your CMakeLists.txt *before* you include this file.

::

 HAVE_ISYSTEM      - true required to replace -I by -isystem on g++

For convenience include Use_wxWindows.cmake in your project's
CMakeLists.txt using
include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/Use_wxWindows.cmake).

USAGE

::

 set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)
 find_package(wxWindows)

NOTES wxWidgets 2.6.x is supported for monolithic builds e.g.
compiled in wx/build/msw dir as:

::

 nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug SHARED=0 USE_OPENGL=1 MONOLITHIC=1

DEPRECATED

::

 CMAKE_WX_CAN_COMPILE
 WXWINDOWS_LIBRARY
